                <p><strong>(16_june_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    We are heading towards a virtual reality. A non-inclusive reality, without physical contact 
                    nor interaction with our surroundings. What if instead of creating tools to isolate ourselves 
                    from the real world, we create to be more connected, to feel and perceive more of what surrounds 
                    us? <br><br>
                    
                    SYNE is a project that focuses on the perception of the environment and the use of our senses. The 
                    artefacts developed allow people to play, experiment, learn and empathise with their senses and 
                    explore reality and get to know it in a different way. Contrary to new technologies that isolate 
                    from the real world, SYNE aims at connecting people with their surroundings through different 
                    devices designed to interact either with the external world or with other subjects. <br><br>

                    Within this page, you can check the Thesis of this master's that explains all the project including 
                    the process followed during the whole year and the final purpose.

                <p>
                    Apart from the documentation, I recorded and edited a video to explain in a more visual way
                    the aim of the project. I also included some images of the prototypes I've been designing during
                    the master's in collaboration with Vikrant, Borka and Pippa.

                    Finally, these are some pictures of the devices and tools used in different contexts. Here we 
                    can find the three main tools of SYNE: C2S, the arm wearable, SFEEL, the sensing ball, and 
                    PUZ(3D), the 3D puzzle with sound.
