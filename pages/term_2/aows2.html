                <p><strong>(25_march_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    These sessions of Atlas of Weak Signals 2.0 were run by Jose Luis de Vicente, a cultural 
                    researcher and curator working in the space between the arts, technology, and innovation. 
                    He was the creator of the concept of Weak Signals, situations that set trends in a specific 
                    direction. During these sessions, Jose Luis tried to explain his vision of some of the hot topics 
                    and crises we are living in nowadays. <br><br>
                
                    <h3><span>.climate_emergency</span></h3><br>

                    The first session of this course put the focus on climate change and the environmental emergency 
                    we have reached. We went to the focus of the problem, what brought us to this point, how the 
                    industrial revolution and mass consumption affected the planet. We talked about the current reality 
                    and some situations created by climate change and the increase in temperature all around the globe. 
                    Finally, we discussed the future consequences this can have if we don't start doing things in 
                    another way, both environmental and social. <br><br>
                    It was a bit scary and hopeless to see everything that was going on but sometimes it's necessary 
                    to have this critical mind and assume what has been done in order to change what is to come. <br><br><br>

                    <h3><span>.jobs_and_work</span></h3><br>

                    <img src="../../images/amazon1.jpg" width="700px"> <br><br>

                    During the second session, the hot topic was "jobs". We began the session by discussing what a job 
                    is and means to us. Many interesting ideas came out such as "a trade of time" or "a creation of 
                    self-worth". Jose Luis explained some facts about jobs in relation to salaries, and how the 1% of 
                    the population has the same amount of money as the other 99%. We talked about job automation and 
                    how this could transform our roles in society. How this could make a part of the population "useless". 
                    We also reflected on how would society be if people didn't have to work and of course, this led to 
                    many different opinions divided into "we would have more time for ourselves" and "we wouldn't know 
                    what to do".  <br><br>
                    I found it really interesting to reflect on this topic. We are always told to work and to get a 
                    job and to earn money and we never think of what's behind it, of our role in the system and of what 
                    could happen in the next years. <br><br><br>

                    <h3><span>.nations_and_states</span></h3><br>

                    <img src="../../images/flags1.png" width="700px"> <br><br>

                    Finally, the third session dealt with the subject of nations and states. We talked about the 
                    identities and backgrounds of our families and how unique we are when we are all mixed together. 
                    We discussed the role states have nowadays, and how they became just another way of separating 
                    people and creating differences between equals. How being part of a state gives you a higher status 
                    than being part of another. How this potentiates classism and racism. <br><br>
                    In my opinion, no borders would be needed if everyone respected every nation's culture, language 
                    and traditions, without wanting to impose a culture or a way of doing things over another. <br><br>
