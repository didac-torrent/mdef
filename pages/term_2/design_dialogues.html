                <p><strong>(03_april_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    Design Dialogues 2 has been an inflexion point regarding the topic I have chosen for my project. 
                    It confirmed that what I'm doing is what I want to do, at least for the next two months. It has 
                    been another chance of interacting with people, getting input and ideas from my classmates and 
                    from external minds, and finding out the work everyone has been doing during this last trimester. <br><br>

                    Again, I arrived at Design Dialogues with less strength than ever. The amount of work of this 
                    trimester combined with emotional fragility due to personal reasons, and the incapability of having 
                    a bit of time for myself and to reflect on what I want to do didn't help to prepare this exhibition 
                    in a proper way. However, in the past weeks, I had returned to the wearables topic and started being 
                    motivated again, after some weeks of desperation, uncertainty and lots of stress. <br><br><br>
                    
                    <img src="../../images/dialogues4.jpeg" width="700px"> <br><br><br>

                    This time I wanted to show two main things: sensorial wearables and explorations with generative 
                    and computational design. As you can see, both topics are quite far from the project I presented 
                    during Design Dialogues 1, Plant B. This is the result of thinking and rethinking again about my 
                    interests and what I want to learn with my project. <br><br>

                    With Vikrant, we developed an intervention called Extended Organelles (you can find it HERE) that 
                    helped us hypothesise about wearables and senses in different situations. We also developed a 
                    bracelet that allowed us to transform colour into sound for the <a id="hype" href="https://github.com/vikmish/Fab-Challenge-2/blob/main/README.md" 
                    target="_blank">MICROCHALLENGE 2</a> of FabAcademy. 
                    I presented both things and some other ideas and concepts of possible wearables to be. <br><br>

                    Thanks to exhibiting this work, I was able to collect really interesting feedback from Kristina 
                    Andersen and other people visiting our projects. Without any doubt, I will reflect on the ideas 
                    they gave me and try to use them in my project and following iterations.
