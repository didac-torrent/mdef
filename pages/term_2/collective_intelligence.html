                <p><strong>(27_february_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    This brief course was an introduction to the Internet, the importance it has taken during the last 
                    30 years, the infrastructure behind it and some new elements that are becoming popular nowadays, 
                    like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. <br><br>

                    During the first session, Guillem and Victor made an introduction to the different layers internet 
                    has, separating the physical world from the digital one. We talked about protocols and the reasons 
                    why accessing the internet is free. We know World Wide Web but there are many other protocols that 
                    didn't become as popular but that can be widely used for other purposes (p.e. Gemini). The websites 
                    we visit every day are just platforms created following a specific protocol. <br><br>

                    On the other hand, we also discussed which is the needed infrastructure for us to use the internet 
                    in our daily lives. There is so much behind and many nodes and connections we don't know at all, and 
                    all the information runs through cables all around the world. This is a brief summary of how the 
                    whole system works: <br><br><br>

                    As for the second session, I was sick of Covid and didn't have any access to the information shown 
                    in class nor any presentation to check. I think it doesn't make sense that we are talking about the 
                    internet and connectivity and then we cannot have access to that information from our houses. 
                    Anyway, I hope I can reflect more on this topic with the third and last session of Collective 
                    Intelligence.
