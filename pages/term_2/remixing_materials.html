                <p> <strong>(23_january_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    This first week of Exploring Emergent Technologies discussed the topic of biomaterials 
                    though the course Remixing Mateirals. Lara Campos, an argentinian designer with an extensive 
                    experience in creating and using biomaterials, was in charge of the workshop and during 
                    this first session she gave us an introduction to the topic. 
                </p>

                    <p>
                    Lara started the session by introducing some of the projects she has been working on 
                    these last years. Personally, I found very interesting 'Ceggmica', a project based on 
                    creating materials from egg shells, and 'En(des)use', a project that consisted of designing 
                    with biomaterials, giving them a use beyond experimentation. <br><br>

                    On the other hand, Lara also highlighted the fact that materials communicate and provoke 
                    feelings, emotions and sensations. It is relevant the way we interact with the material 
                    itself and thinking of the way it is related to nature and culture. She showed us the 
                    diagram on the right that explains materials in design.

                <p>
                    Finally, she explained to us the basics of the composition of every biomaterial: a biopolymer, 
                    a plasticizer, the additives and the solvent. Each of these components has different alternatives 
                    one can use, that of course will give many diverse properties to the biomaterials we are cooking. 
                    We also had the chance to touch and analyse some biomaterial samples Lara had brought and think of 
                    some uses we could give them. <br><br>

                <p> <strong>(30_january_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    During this second session of Remixing Materials with Lara Campos, we had the chance to experiment 
                    with different kinds of biomaterials using a wide diversity of food waste and colourants. Before 
                    the workshop, we were told to collect our own food waste, dry it and grind it in order to be able 
                    to use it for the biomaterials we were going to produce. In my case, I collected some sunflower 
                    shells that I further ground to a small size. <br><br>
                
                </p>

                <div class="img3">

                </div>

                <p>
                    The first biomaterial we created was made out of gelatine. We used the recipe to cook them and some 
                    circular shapes with the fabric below as a mould. We poured the mix into the mould and then started 
                    adding all the other components: eggshells, orange peels, ground coffee, fern leaves, sunflower 
                    shells, etcetera. We also used different colours of Mica as colourants that gave the biomaterial 
                    an amazing glossy look. Once it dried, the piece we created became stronger but also jelly and gummy. 
                    Also, since all the water evaporated, it became much thinner and the food waste gained in importance. <br>
                </p>

                
                <div class="beside">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                        Later on, we created a biomaterial using alginate as the main composite. Again, we used a cooking 
                        pot to join all the components together and then divides the resultant dense mix in two: the first 
                        one, we used it the same way that the gelatine one and poured it into a circular shape with fabric; 
                        the other half was used to create threads using a syringe and a pot filled with a calcium chloride 
                        solution. <br><br>
                        
                        It was surprising seeing how the liquid became solid instantly when touching the solution 
                        and created this weird texture such as a jellyfish. When dry, the thread became much thinner and also 
                        rigid and fragile, quite the opposite than it was before. <br>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                </div>
                
                <p>
                    Finally, we used resin to create the last biomaterial. This recipe was a bit more tricky since resin 
                    has very specific characteristics: it had to be solved in alcohol (not water), the mould needs to be 
                    silicon or be covered with baking paper, and the cooking time is extremely important. Again, we used 
                    our food waste and mixed it with the resin inside the cooking pot, then poured it into the mould. In 
                    my case, I mixed the resin with the partially ground sunflower shells and ground coffee as a colourant. <br><br>

                    Reflecting on this workshop, I think it has been a really instructive and interesting way to approach 
                    the topic of biomaterials. As far as I am concerned, I had never worked with biomaterials before and 
                    having the chance of getting to know this new subject has been a great experience that enables me to 
                    further explore the opportunities of these biomaterials. I believe this is the main question now: What 
                    can we do with that? <br><br>

                <p>
                    Lara told us to keep exploring the possibilities and to try to go further, so I decided to create 
                    an object out of biomaterial, not only a sample. The day we had the workshop I wanted to create 
                    an ashtray out of a rigid biomaterial, probably resin. However, I didn't have enough time and material 
                    to prepare it properly and it didn't work out well. So, I decided to develop a new ashtray from 
                    scratch that I could reproduce as many times as I wanted. <br><br>

                    I started thinking of an original shape for the ashtray and then 3D modelled it on SolidWorks, 
                    taking into account that there weren't inaccessible parts nor right angles. Secondly, I sliced the 
                    part and printed it on my 3D printer. After this, I used silicon to form the mould of the ashtray 
                    that can be used with many different materials. Finally, I used the resin recipe doubled the 
                    quantities and added some burnt wood and ashes to give it colour. This is the result of the 
                    experiment: <br><br>
