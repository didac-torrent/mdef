                <p> <strong>(06_february_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    Kate started this course of "Communication, brand and purpose" by telling us a bit of the 
                    story of branding. It was interesting to see how this idea of promoting something comes from 
                    really far and it has been always in human beings lives, having evidence of branding examples 
                    in Egypt and Mesopotamia at 3000 bC. <br><br>

                    The act of communicating something has changed over the years and as well as the society itself. 
                    Nowadays, capitalism has turned communication into something fundamental to increase sales and 
                    control people by sending the exact message through ad campaigns, everyday products we buy, 
                    places we go, etc. We learn to associate each message or image to a brand that sells a whole 
                    experience by storytelling. <br><br>

                    During the session, we saw some examples such as the whole campaign of cigarettes for women, 
                    McDonald's colours, celebrities becoming part of the publicity of brands, communication in 
                    politics, etc. Kate also showed us some other examples of communicating in a good way with 
                    well-thought storytelling such as Everlane, OatLy, Hemps Normal and some others. <br><br>

                    Finally, we were told to start thinking about our project and our branding, what message do we 
                    want to send, how do we want our brand to look from outside. This is the result of analysing 
                    each of the points in relation to my project and how I want it to be: <br><br>
