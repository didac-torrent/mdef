                <p> <strong>(23_january_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    This first week of Exploring Emergent Technologies discussed the topic of biomaterials 
                    though the course Remixing Mateirals. Lara Campos, an argentinian designer with an extensive 
                    experience in creating and using biomaterials, was in charge of the workshop and during 
                    this first session she gave us an introduction to the topic. 
                </p>
                
                <div class="beside">
                    <div>
                    <p>
                    Lara started the session by introducing some of the projects she has been working on 
                    these last years. Personally, I found very interesting 'Ceggmica', a project based on 
                    creating materials from egg shells, and 'En(des)use', a project that consisted of designing 
                    with biomaterials, giving them a use beyond experimentation. <br><br>

                    On the other hand, Lara also highlighted the fact that materials communicate and provoke 
                    feelings, emotions and sensations. It is relevant the way we interact with the material 
                    itself and thinking of the way it is related to nature and culture. She showed us the 
                    diagram on the right that explains materials in design.

                </div>

                <p>
                    Finally, she explained to us the basics of the composition of every biomaterial: a biopolymer, 
                    a plasticizer, the additives and the solvent. Each of these components has different alternatives 
                    one can use, that of course will give many diverse properties to the biomaterials we are cooking. 
                    We also had the chance to touch and analyse some biomaterial samples Lara had brought and think of 
                    some uses we could give them. <br><br>
