            <h2>/weekOne.bootcamp</h2>
            <p id="one">This has been the first week in this new adventure. Still, I feel like 
                I've been in it for a while now. This past month I have had the opportunity 
                to get to know my classmates one by one. Unlike them, I already knew the city, 
                I had a place to sleep and I also had friends around here. That's exactly why 
                meeting them has been so special and exciting. It has been a breath of fresh air 
                and a big break from my routine, which can sometimes be very monotonous. <br> <br>
                I feel very privileged to meet such diverse people with such different backgrounds from 
                all over the world. I think we all ended up here with the idea of learning from 
                each other and creating projects together, and I have no doubt that this is what 
                will happen.

            <div Class="fight">
                
                <div class="text">
                <h3><span>.what_is_your_fight?</span></h3>
                <p id="two">
                    On the first day of the bootcamp we had to bring a poster on the topic 
                    <em><strong>What is your fight?</strong></em>. On this poster we had to reflect any concern,
                    personal interest or cause we wanted to fight 
                    or in our future. Thinking about how to approach this question was not so simple since 
                    there are many things to work on and a lot to change. I finally decided to focus my poster 
                    with the concept <strong><em>empathy</em></strong>. <br><br>
                    There is a lack of empathy in politics, a lack of empathy with migrant people, a lack 
                    of empathy on gender issues, a lack of empathy between social classes, and so on. That 
                    is why I believe that we, the ones who are going to define what the world looks like in 
                    the coming years, have to focus on creating with empathy, with consciousness and 
                    inclusiveness. <br><br>
                    Finally, I surrounded the concept with other ideas and values that I want to keep in mind 
                    in my professional future: sustainability, innovation, cooperation and social sphere. All 
                    this is what constitutes my fight.

            <h3><span>.elisava_&_studio_class</span></h3>
            <p id="one">
                During the week, we also visited <em>ELISAVA</em> and its spaces. We could see all the tools 
                at our disposal in the workshops and laboratories (really impressive).
                We also had our first Studio Class there, where Oscar explained the difference between 
                1st, 2nd and 3rd person design and how important it is to get involved and surround 
                yourself with the collective you are designing for. Designing in 1st person also allows 
                you to see the resources at your disposal, the intra-relationships of the community, 
                the infrastructures, etc. <br><br>
                The second part of the session was dedicated to getting to know our classmates 
                better, telling each other about our skills, knowledge and attitude. It was a very 
                useful exercise to start getting to know the background and intentions of the other 
                members of the class. In addition, we were given the task of reflecting on our skills, 
                knowledge and attitude on each of the subjects we are going to deal with in this master's 
                course and, subsequently, thinking about what our challenges and aims are, what we want 
                to have learned by the end of the course.

            <h3><span>.poblenou_tour</span></h3>
            <p id="one">
                The week ended with a tour around some of the infinite art, creation and cooperation 
                spaces in Poblenou. Firstly, we visited the headquarters of <em>Poblenou Urban District</em>, 
                an art gallery where the whole project of collaboration with the different creative 
                spaces in the neighbourhood is organised. After walking two streets we arrived at 
                <em>TransfoLAB</em>, a workshop with the aim of creating new designs and forms from trash and 
                obsolete objects. Then we visited <em>BiciHub</em>, a large building focused on the rehabilitation 
                of bicycles to later give them a second life and also with a workshop where anyone can 
                fix their own bike. Finally, we ended the visit at <em>ConnectHort</em> (soon <em>Bioma</em>), a place 
                dedicated to gardening and community activities. <br><br>
                Getting to know these places was a wonderful experience and made me want to investigate 
                and get to know more innovative places like these. I will need to find some time to do 
                another tour on my own.
