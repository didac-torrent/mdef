                        <p>
                            This week's topic focused on biology from zero, travelling from the composition 
                            of the smallest to organisms and multicellular living beings. Even considering the 
                            fact that a lot of information has been given in the few sessions we have had and 
                            it has not been easy to assimilate all the content, this course has been useful to 
                            create a solid foundation in the subject of biology and to experiment with materials 
                            that some of us had not had the opportunity to try until now. <br><br>

                            The most instructive part of this week, in my opinion, has been the practical 
                            sessions we have been doing in the afternoons, where everything explained in 
                            the morning made sense and the practical functionality of the contents was 
                            understood. <br><br>

                            On the first day, each of us created a medium for different types of growth, 
                            in my case Axitic for Lactobacillus. To do so, we had to calculate the right 
                            proportion of three products: tomato juice, agar agar and Marmite together 
                            with water. Then we sterilised the mixture with a pressure cooker and finally 
                            we created a sterile environment with the Bunsen lighter to distribute the 
                            mixture between the different Petri dishes. The next day we added the culture 
                            we wanted to grow to the media and put it in the incubator at a temperature of 
                            35ºC to create the environment for the growth. <br><br>

                            The second practical session focused on the cultivation and applications of 
                            Spirulina, an algae considered a superfood thanks to its high amount of 
                            proteins, vitamins and nutrients. During the session we prepared the ideal 
                            environment for the growth of this algae and saw the procedure to cultivate it. 
                            We also created a mixture of tea and sugar to grow a small piece of Kambucha that 
                            Núria had given us. After the session, Chris developed a system for pumping the 
                            water out of the Spirulina with an ESP32 board and a relay. The pumping of the water 
                            allows the algae to receive the necessary oxygen in all parts of the culture. <br><br>

                            Finally, Thursday's session was dedicated to exploring different materials and 
                            organisms with microscopes in order to identify their composition and content. 
                            Even though my knowledge does not allow me to recognise every single shape 
                            under the microscope, it was a great experience to be able to see forms and 
                            textures with the magnifying lenses and get a different perspective of what 
                            is around us. I actually found it very artistic to contemplate all this and 
                            I think the photographs I took explain why. <br><br>
