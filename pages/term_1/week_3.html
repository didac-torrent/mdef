                        <p><strong>(24_october_2021)</strong><br><br>

                            This week's topic focused on biology from zero, travelling from the composition 
                            of the smallest to organisms and multicellular living beings. Even considering the 
                            fact that a lot of information has been given in the few sessions we have had and 
                            it has not been easy to assimilate all the content, this course has been useful to 
                            create a solid foundation in the subject of biology and to experiment with materials 
                            that some of us had not had the opportunity to try until now. <br><br>

                            The most instructive part of this week, in my opinion, has been the practical 
                            sessions we have been doing in the afternoons, where everything explained in 
                            the morning made sense and the practical functionality of the contents was 
                            understood. <br><br>

                            <strong><em>/CREATING_A_MEDIUM</em></strong><br>
                            On the first day, each of us created a medium for different types of growth, 
                            in my case Axitic for Lactobacillus. To do so, we had to calculate the right 
                            proportion of three products: tomato juice, agar agar and Marmite together 
                            with water. Then we sterilised the mixture with a pressure cooker and finally 
                            we created a sterile environment with the Bunsen lighter to distribute the 
                            mixture between the different Petri dishes. The next day we added the culture 
                            we wanted to grow to the media and put it in the incubator at a temperature of 
                            35ºC to create the environment for the growth. <br><br>

                            <strong><em>/GETTING_TO_KNOW_SPIRULINA</em></strong><br>
                            The second practical session focused on the cultivation and applications of 
                            Spirulina, an algae considered a superfood thanks to its high amount of 
                            proteins, vitamins and nutrients. During the session we prepared the ideal 
                            environment for the growth of this algae and saw the procedure to cultivate it. 
                            We also created a mixture of tea and sugar to grow a small piece of Kambucha that 
                            Núria had given us. After the session, Chris developed a system for pumping the 
                            water out of the Spirulina with an ESP32 board and a relay. The pumping of the water 
                            allows the algae to receive the necessary oxygen in all parts of the culture. <br><br>

                            <strong><em>/PLAYING_WITH_MICROSCOPES</em></strong><br>
                            Thursday's session was dedicated to exploring different materials and 
                            organisms with microscopes in order to identify their composition and content. 
                            Even though my knowledge does not allow me to recognise every single shape 
                            under the microscope, it was a great experience to be able to see forms and 
                            textures with the magnifying lenses and get a different perspective of what 
                            is around us. I actually found it very artistic to contemplate all this and 
                            I think the photographs I took explain why. <br><br>

                            <strong><em>/USING_A_PCR</em></strong><br>
                            On the last day of bio Núria showed us the procedure to do a PCR test. For 
                            this, specific tools are needed, specifically a machine that creates 
                            temperature cycles of 95-50-72ºC, another one that performs the electrophoresis 
                            and finally a blue light transilluminator to see the result. <br><br>

                <h3><span>.summary_of_a_paper</span></h3>
                <p id="one">
                    For the task of reading and summarising a scientific article I decided to choose 
                    one related to neuroscience. Neuroscience is a field of science that studies the 
                    nervous system from molecular to cognitive and behavioural studies. This field has 
                    always fascinated me, specifically the fact of being able to give an empirical and 
                    scientific answer to some actions or disorders developed in individuals. In this 
                    case, I wanted to focus the study of neuroscience on addictions, a very common 
                    problem among young people, and I wanted to find out more about it. <br><br>

                    <em><strong>NEUROSCIENCE OF ADDICTION</strong><br>
                    G F Koob , P P Sanna, F E Bloom <br>
                    DOI: 10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80557-7</em> <br><br>

                    The article begins by talking about adolescents and the fact that they are more 
                    vulnerable to addiction by linking it to brain development. However, it says that 
                    the genetic component is 40-60% responsible for this, as well as the environment 
                    and personal situations. Young people start taking drugs because they are in a 
                    phase of risk-taking and novelty-seeking, and in some cases consumption goes further. 
                    Knowing more about the brain could help to find ways to change these habits. <br><br>

                    In relation to diseases, it says that people with a disorder are more likely to 
                    be addicted and vice versa. Some people with disorders tend to self-medicate and 
                    that ends up creating addiction. Still, it says there is not enough evidence to make 
                    a direct link. <br><br>

                    It goes on to describe the consequences of being in a risky environment and how 
                    this affects drug use. In some environments it is much easier to obtain drugs and 
                    poor socio-economic status together with poor family support can be aspects that 
                    promote drug use. <br><br>

                    Finally, it was pointed out that neuronal repair of the brains of people who have 
                    been drug dependent is not easy. Brain adaptations are usually long-lasting and 
                    reversing changes is not an easy task, in fact, sometimes it is practically impossible. 
                    This affects physical aspects such as mobility, but also social aspects such as 
                    interaction with other people. <br><br>

                    This exercise consisted of conceptually creating a mutation of some organism (plant, 
                    animal, human, etc.) to somehow resolve a problem on our planet. This idea was based 
                    on the foundations of iGEM, a website that serves as a source of biohacking information 
                    and works as a knowledge network. The objective was to find the agent or protein that 
                    acts in this process, analyse its functions and finally discuss what method we would 
                    use to carry out the mutation, playing with the organism's code. <br><br>

                <p id="one">
                    In my case, I decided to tackle one of the biggest issues nowadays, the amount of CO2 
                    in the atmosphere and more specifically in the city of Barcelona. To address this 
                    problem, I decided to look for the protein responsible for photosynthesis RuBisCO and 
                    apply it through CRISPR-Cas9 to insects, since they represent a large population of 
                    cities and are everywhere. <br><br>

                    Obviously this modification is not at all ethical and would not be the optimal 
                    solution in any case, it is simply a way of playing with genetics. Correcting this 
                    problem would be a matter of changing our mentality and our consumption behaviour to 
                    reduce the gases emitted rather than modifying other species.
