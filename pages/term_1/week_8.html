                        <p><strong>(28_november_2021)</strong><br><br>
                            This week, Mercè and Markel from HOLON conducted the sessions related to 
                            community engagement. In these classes, the members of HOLON made us think 
                            about our way of designing and creating, where often our vision is not always 
                            open and all the effort is focused on developing the project individually. <br><br>
                            This way of working that we follow is so integrated that it doesn't allow you 
                            to contribute to a common objective, which is why Markel and Mercè suggested 
                            that we act differently: before establishing a specific project idea, observe 
                            and try to investigate what projects there are around your idea, what 
                            communities exist and what tasks are being done, how the topic you want to 
                            work on is approached from other perspectives. Taking all these factors into 
                            account, you may be able to contribute much more to your target, and you may 
                            also be able to participate in a network of projects focused on the same topic. <br><br>

                    During the four days of this course, we worked on our collaborative design intervention 
                    and focused the exercises proposed to us on the theme that each group had chosen. <br><br>
                    The first exercise proposed to us to create a stronger basis for our interventions 
                    was to create a mapping of the projects in Barcelona and its surroundings related to 
                    our theme. In our case, the group formed by Chris, Juaco and myself, our main topics are 
                    technology, music and nature. From there, we started to look for communities and projects 
                    around these subjects, separately and also combining them (nature-technology, 
                    music-technology, nature-music). This was the result of our mapping: <br><br>

            <div class="content">

                <p>
                    After this, we had to analyse in a more precise way the role of the actors involved 
                    in our map. The aim of this second exercise was to get to know in more depth what 
                    tasks the other communities and individuals are carrying out in order to define more 
                    clearly what the direction of collaboration and contribution in the field could be. 
                    Therefore, we chose the agent that we thought could be most relevant and defined the 
                    following topics: context, current situation, engagement & limits, theory of change 
                    and design opportunities. <br><br>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Finally, starting from a multiscalar diagram, we had to situate the agents of our 
                    map according to four different levels of impact on the matter in question: parameters, 
                    feedback, design and intervention. This allowed us to see how the agents involved
                    to our topic are related to the global scene and the role of each of the parts. <br><br>
