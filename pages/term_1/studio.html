            <p id="one">In this first task I will create my own development plan based on the 
                instructions and the work done during the first Design Studio class, starting 
                by giving a vision of the future taking into account the poster of the first day, 
                and ending by making a draft of what my plan could be. <br><br>
            </p>

            <h3><span>.my_vision_of_the_future</span></h3>
                
            <p id="two">As I have explained in class and in the weekly relfections, my main fight is based 
                on empathy. Today, our society has many issues because people have no empathy, they 
                don't put themselves in other people's shoes and they only think about themselves.
                Many things would change if people would try to understand the realities of others,
                the situations they have to live through, the things some people have to put up with. 
                With empathy, wealth would be distributed in a better way, no one would judge anyone 
                for being different, we would think more about our planet and society would work much 
                more smoothly. <br><br>
                As a designer, I want to bring the concept of empathy to my field. I believe that good 
                design only makes sense if it is empathetic, if it has a function to improve living 
                conditions, if it is able to help. And don't get me wrong, design based only on aesthetics 
                is a very important and relevant art form, but, from my perspective, form always has to be 
                tied to function, and function has to be the main goal.
               
            </p>

            <p id="one">
                If every designer was now focused on creating with empathy, the future society would 
                be nothing like today's society. In the end, our designs and creations are what define
                our environment, and the more empathetic our environment is, the more empathetic we 
                will be too.
