            <p id="one">In this first task I will create my own development plan based on the 
                instructions and the work done during the first Design Studio class, starting 
                by giving a vision of the future taking into account the poster of the first day, 
                and ending by making a draft of what my plan could be. <br><br>
            </p>

            <h3><span>.vision_of_the_future</span></h3>
                
            <p id="two">As I have explained in class and in the weekly relfections, my main fight is based 
                on empathy. Today, our society has many problems because people forget about this value. 
                No one puts his/herself in other people's shoes and everyone looks after the own interests.
                Many things would change if people would try to understand the realities of others,
                the situations they have to live through, the issues some people have to put up with. 
                With empathy, wealth would be distributed in a better way, nobody would judge those outside
                the standards, we would all think more about our environment and society would work much 
                smoothly. <br><br>
                As a designer, I want to bring the concept to my field. I believe that good 
                design only makes sense if it is empathetic, if it has a function to improve living 
                conditions, if it is capable of helping. And don't get me wrong, design based only on aesthetics 
                is a relevant art form but, from my perspective, form always has to be 
                tied to function, and this has to be the main goal.
               
            </p>

            <p id="one">
                If every designer was now focused on creating with empathy, the future society would 
                be nothing like today's. In the end, our creations are what define our environment, 
                and the more empathetic our environment is, the more empathetic we will be.
