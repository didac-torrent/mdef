                <p id="one">In this first task I will create my own development plan based on the 
                    instructions and the work done during the first Design Studio class, starting 
                    by giving a vision of the future taking into account the poster of the first day, 
                    and ending by making a draft of what my plan could be. <br><br>
                </p>

                        <p id="one">As I have explained in class and in the weekly relfections, my main fight is based 
                            on empathy. Today, our society has many problems because people forget about this value. 
                            No one puts his/herself in other people's shoes and everyone looks after the own interests.
                            Many things would change if people would try to understand the realities of others,
                            the situations they have to live through, the issues some people have to put up with. 
                            With empathy, wealth would be distributed in a better way, nobody would judge those outside
                            the standards, we would all think more about our environment and society would work much 
                            smoothly. <br><br>
                            As a designer, I want to bring the concept to my field. I believe that good 
                            design only makes sense if it is empathetic, if it has a function to improve living 
                            conditions, if it is capable of helping. And don't get me wrong, design based only on aesthetics 
                            is a relevant art form but, from my perspective, form always has to be 
                            tied to function, and this has to be the main goal.

                <p id="one">
                    If every designer was now focused on creating with empathy, the future society would 
                    be nothing like today's. In the end, our creations are what define our environment, 
                    and the more empathetic our environment is, the more empathetic we will be.

                    In this second part of the assignment I have been developing the process of analysis 
                    and reflection on myself and my expectations for this master's degree. As you can see 
                    in the diagram below, this process consists of 4 steps. The first two are the result 
                    of the work we did in the first Design Studio session and two others come out of the 
                    subsequent personal work. The subjects developed in this diagram are the following:
                    
                    <div class="diagram">
                        <strong>1.</strong> Description of my identity in terms of skills, knowledge and attitude. <br><br>
                        <strong>2.</strong> Concepts that caught the attention from my classmates after doing the 
                        meetings and talking about our skills, knowledge and attitude. <br><br>
                        <strong>3.</strong> Desired professional identity based on my vision and on the conversations 
                        with my classmates. <br><br>
                        <strong>4.</strong> What I want to learn from the courses I will take during this 
                        master's degree. <br>

                <p id="one">
                    I would like to focus my personal development plan on the idea I had when I decided 
                    to choose this master's degree, which was to discover new fields and explore many 
                    different areas. My intention was to improve my resources as a maker, learning more 
                    about electronics and programming, materials and prototyping machines. However, after 
                    these reflections I have realised that I also want to learn about other fields such as 
                    project documentation and communication, working with communities, discovering the world 
                    of AI, biology and agriculture, etc. So my personal development plan will be founded 
                    on getting to know in depth all these topics that I haven't yet had the opportunity to 
                    deal with and then be able to use them in my professional future.
