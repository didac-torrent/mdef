                    instructions and the work done during the first Design Studio class, starting 
                    by giving a vision of the future taking into account the poster of the first day, 
                    and ending by making a draft of what my plan could be. <br><br>

                        <p id="one">As I have explained in class and in the weekly relfections, my main fight is based 
                            on empathy. Today, our society has many problems because people forget about this value. 
                            No one puts his/herself in other people's shoes and everyone looks after the own interests.
                            Many things would change if people would try to understand the realities of others,
                            the situations they have to live through, the issues some people have to put up with. 
                            With empathy, wealth would be distributed in a better way, nobody would judge those outside
                            the standards, we would all think more about our environment and society would work much 
                            smoothly. <br><br>
                            As a designer, I want to bring the concept to my field. I believe that good 
                            design only makes sense if it is empathetic, if it has a function to improve living 
                            conditions, if it is capable of helping. And don't get me wrong, design based only on aesthetics 
                            is a relevant art form but, from my perspective, form always has to be 
                            tied to function, and this has to be the main goal.

                    If every designer was now focused on creating with empathy, the future society would 
                    be nothing like today's. In the end, our creations are what define our environment, 
                    and the more empathetic our environment is, the more empathetic we will be.

                    In this second part of the assignment I have been developing the process of analysis 
                    and reflection on myself and my expectations for this master's degree. As you can see 
                    in the diagram below, this process consists of 4 steps. The first two are the result 
                    of the work we did in the first Design Studio session and two others come out of the 
                    subsequent personal work. The subjects developed in this diagram are the following:

                    I would like to focus my personal development plan on the idea I had when I decided 
                    to choose this master's degree, which was to discover new fields and explore many 
                    different areas. My intention was to improve my resources as a maker, learning more 
                    about electronics and programming, materials and prototyping machines. However, after 
                    these reflections I have realised that I also want to learn about other fields such as 
                    project documentation and communication, working with communities, discovering the world 
                    of AI, biology and agriculture, etc. So my personal development plan will be founded 
                    on getting to know in depth all these topics that I haven't yet had the opportunity to 
                    deal with and then be able to use them in my professional future. <br>

                <h2>/design_studio_2</h2>

                <p id="one">In this week's Design Studio session, Oscar introduced us to the concept of 
                    Research through Design, a research approach that employs methods and processes from 
                    design practice as a research method. We also saw the Workspaces of some alumni of our 
                    master, along with the methodology they applied in their final projects. <br><br>
                    In addition to this, we also learned about some of the many prototyping roles that 
                    exist and that are often used in design processes. Each of these roles is used in 
                    different contexts and with very different purposes. They are generally intended as a 
                    way to collect information, although this is not always the ultimate goal. The main 
                    roles presented were the following: <br>
                    
                    <div class="diagram">
                        <strong>1.</strong> Prototype as an experimental component. Prototyping only to 
                        get certain information you want to know or solve. Test of hypothesis.<br><br>
                        <strong>2.</strong> Prototype as a mean of inquiry. Not the definitive prototype 
                        but a way to gather information. Not the object you want to design but an object 
                        to get data and as much information as possible. Open-ended exploration. The data 
                        you collect is qualitative. Empirical.<br><br>
                        <strong>3.</strong> Prototype as a research archetype. Physical embodiments of 
                        concepts, understandings or design spaces that can be argued to constitute 
                        contributions to the discipline. The role is exemplary. It shows the possibilities 
                        of a topic. <br><br>
                        <strong>4.</strong> Prototype as a vehicle for inquiry. The process is documented 
                        and the research contribution is not tied to the artefact but to the process and 
                        how the artefact was crafted. Not testing, not trying to get anything, just a way 
                        to set a reference of what you did.<br><br>

                <h3><span>.creating_a_workspace</span></h3>

                <p id="one">
                    This week's task consisted of analysing the resources we have at our disposal for 
                    the project, considering infrastructure, materials, tools and people, and then creating 
                    our own Workspace related to our personal development plan. In addition to this, I have 
                    started a new Design Space from scratch, with a totally different theme. Thanks to the 
                    work done during the previous week, I realised that the Weak Signals I had originally 
                    chosen did not motivate me enough. With this in mind, I decided to start again and I 
                    feel the concepts and ideas I have now are closer to what I want to do this year. <br><br>
                    The Workspace I show below already contains the resources related to my new Design 
                    Space. This is the result of this reflection: <br><br>

                <p id="one">
                    In this second part of the exercise, I have added in my Design Space some of the 
                    prototyping roles previously discussed, relating them to my context and to the 
                    resources shown in my workspace. The fact that I have recently changed my design 
                    space has not helped much in this part of the work since I feel that I need a little 
                    more time to make some research and to dive into the new chosen topic. <br><br>
                    This is how my Design Space looks like after adding the prototyping roles with the 
                    first ideas that came to my mind: <br><br>

                <h3><span>.first_experiment</span></h3>

                <p id="one">
                    This last part of the task consisted in performing a first experiment, based on one 
                    or more of the prototyping roles. In my case, I have chosen to use the
                    role number one on the list (prototype as an experimental component) in order to make 
                    a first test related to my Design Space and my project. <br><br>
                    For this experiment I used Fusion 360 to carry out a first test on topological 
                    optimisation in 3D printing. I modelled a very simple part where I applied some 
                    forces and after doing the structural analysis I used the generative design tool 
                    to optimize the part and leave only the necessary material so that the part can 
                    withstand the same stresses. In this case, the optimized topology's mass was only
                    the 60% of the non-optimized one. <br><br>

                <p id="one">
                    Finally I printed the two parts, the non-optimised one and the optimised one, and 
                    made an initial strength test with the resources I had at home and trying to apply 
                    the same forces that I had established in the previous structural analysis. <br><br>
                    The purpose of this exercise was to check if 3D printing, in this case FDM, can be a 
                    suitable medium to develop generative design and topological optimisation projects, 
                    two of the main topics of my Design Space and with which I would like to work more in 
                    depth. The next step would be to create a more complex and organic shape and see if 3D 
                    printing is still a possible manufacturing method in this process. <br><br><br>

                <p id="one">
                    In this Design Studio session we again worked on Collaborative Design Spaces. The 
                    intention of continuing to operate in this way is to be able to contemplate beyond 
                    our spaces, visualising and sharing concepts that can extend our knowledge and even 
                    connect our projects with other ideas from our classmates. Since I modified the Design 
                    Space completely, the groups I was in previously no longer corresponded to the subject 
                    matter, so I joined another group that incorporated very different visions and projects. <br><br>

                    Regarding the Collaborative Design Space, we decided to modify the one already created 
                    from the previous session, as members and topics had changed, and grouped them as <strong>"Bio,
                    Tech and Ancestry"</strong>. In discussion, we felt that these three concepts generally grouped 
                    together, in one way or another, the concepts of our projects. The Bio part encompasses 
                    everything related to nature and living things, organic forms and biomaterials. Technology 
                    refers to electronics and mechanics, but also to innovation techniques and processes. 
                    Finally, Ancestry groups the ideas of connection with the past or with other species, 
                    it also relates to empathy and the spiritual part. <br><br>

                </p>

                <p id="one">
                    Starting from this scenario, Oscar asked us to situate ourselves within the 
                    Collaborative Design Space, defining with which parts of it our project is linked 
                    and our future perspectives around it. In my case, my project would be fundamentally 
                    situated between Bio and Tech. As I already defined in my second Design Space, my 
                    main objective right now is to achieve organic shapes, perhaps adapted to the human 
                    body, modelled with generative design and topological optimisation and also adding 
                    some electronic coponents. This idea is a clear mix of these two concepts, the study 
                    of human biology and natural forms with 3D design technology that allows you to 
                    obtain computationally developed models and the electronics. Even so, given that I 
                    want to give a social sense to my project, the fact of also incorporating Ancestry 
                    in the design space has worked very well for me to relate it to empathy and values. <br><br>
                    
                    Concerning the projects of the other members of the group, I found very interesting 
                    Chris's ideas about putting sensors on plants to "make them communicate" from chemical 
                    reactions and emitted frequencies. I think that the topic of communicating with sensors 
                    would be very interesting to incorporate in my project as well. Another topic that 
                    attracted my attention was Juaco's experiment he did with carnivorous plants, where 
                    he put conductive elements in both parts of the "mouth" and when it closed, the circuit 
                    also closed and emitted a signal. I found this combination of nature and electronics 
                    fascinating. Finally, I also thought the subject matter chosen by Nikita was really
                    appealing, the fact of analysing the characteristics of other species of animals and 
                    plants and then seeing how they could be applied to human lives to improve them, even 
                    at a societal level. <br><br>
                    
                    Being able to learn about these ideas certainly opened my mind 
                    in many ways and directions and I hope to be able to do this more often and collaborate 
                    as much as possible with my classmates.
