                <h2>/weekFive.living_with_your_own_ideas</h2>
                <p id="one">This week we attended the course tutored by Oscar Tomico, Kristina Andersen 
                    and Angella Mackey, with the theme "Living with your own ideas". During this four-day 
                    seminar, we had the opportunity to experience, through two workshops, what it means to 
                    embody the concepts we have in our heads. We had to act and test instead of thinking 
                    and hypothesising.

                <h3><span>.make_a_magic_machine</span></h3>
                <p id="one">
                    In this initial workshop organised by Kristina Andersen, we first of all had to make 
                    a drawing of ourselves (not literally, more conceptual) in less than a minute. That 
                    drawing referred to the person we were going to design for that afternoon, Me. From 
                    there, the next step was to start creating a "magic" machine with recycled materials
                    and objects. This machine could have any function we wanted and it didn't have to be 
                    functional, it just had to have a reason why. <br><br>

                    In my case, I used a brick, a wooden cylinder, a rope and some pieces of cardboard 
                    to build the machine. The creation process was really curious: at the beginning I 
                    had no idea what to do and it all seemed very random. As I analysed the materials it 
                    all started to make sense and in this process of development I came up with more ideas 
                    and concepts that gave purpose to my machine. <br><br>

                <p id="one">
                    The Justice Lamp is the name I gave to my machine and it is a combination of a balance 
                    and a lamp, where the light only turns on when the weight of the two sides is the same. 
                    With this I wanted to make a metaphor about equality and justice, considering that only 
                    when there is equilibrium there is light and hope. Also relating it to First Person 
                    Perspective, only when you as a designer empathise and place yourself in the context 
                    you design for, is when the light comes on, synonymous with a good idea. <br><br>

                    After this, we were asked to try to relate our machine to the other machines on the table. 
                    It was quite difficult to try to find common ground considering the huge diversity of 
                    themes of the colleagues' constructions. Nevertheless, Kristina found convergence in the 
                    generally social themes and very much related to empathy, either for other people or for 
                    the elements of nature. <br><br>
