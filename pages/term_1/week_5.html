                    This week we attended the course tutored by Oscar Tomico, Kristina Andersen 
                    and Angella Mackey, with the theme "Living with your own ideas". During this four-day 
                    seminar, we had the opportunity to experience, through two workshops, what it means to 
                    embody the concepts we have in our heads. We had to act and test instead of thinking 
                    and hypothesising.

                <p id="one">
                    In this initial workshop organised by Kristina Andersen, we first of all had to make 
                    a drawing of ourselves (not literally, more conceptual) in less than a minute. That 
                    drawing referred to the person we were going to design for that afternoon, Me. From 
                    there, the next step was to start creating a "magic" machine with recycled materials
                    and objects. This machine could have any function we wanted and it didn't have to be 
                    functional, it just had to have a reason why. <br><br>

                    In my case, I used a brick, a wooden cylinder, a rope and some pieces of cardboard 
                    to build the machine. The creation process was really curious: at the beginning I 
                    had no idea what to do and it all seemed very random. As I analysed the materials it 
                    all started to make sense and in this process of development I came up with more ideas 
                    and concepts that gave purpose to my machine. <br><br>

                    The Justice Lamp is the name I gave to my machine and it is a combination of a balance 
                    and a lamp, where the light only turns on when the weight of the two sides is the same. 
                    With this I wanted to make a metaphor about equality and justice, considering that only 
                    when there is equilibrium there is light and hope. Also relating it to First Person 
                    Perspective, only when you as a designer empathise and place yourself in the context 
                    you design for, is when the light comes on, synonymous with a good idea. <br><br>

                    After this, we were asked to try to relate our machine to the other machines on the table. 
                    It was quite difficult to try to find common ground considering the huge diversity of 
                    themes of the colleagues' constructions. Nevertheless, Kristina found convergence in the 
                    generally social themes and very much related to empathy, either for other people or for 
                    the elements of nature. <br><br>

                    The second workshop of the week carried out by Angella Mackey was totally different 
                    from the first one. It consisted in experimenting for 24 hours what First Person 
                    Perspective means, within the framework of our Design Space if possible. In this 
                    short period of time we had to pose a question we wanted to explore and accompany 
                    it with a personal experimentation exercise. In my case I chose the question <em><strong>"What 
                        if some parts of our body were heavier?"</strong></em>. This is the result: <br><br>

                </p>

                <div class="img2">
                    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/643018819?h=c9c716677c&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479"

                </div>

                <p id="one">
                    As you can see in the video, what I did was to put weights on different parts of my 
                    body and perform the same tasks that I usually do in my daily life. My main intention 
                    was to find out how I would feel if some of my body parts were heavier, and also to 
                    check if it would be comfortable or uncomfortable. Gathering this information was 
                    relevant to my project as my idea focuses on wearables and prosthetics, and having 
                    a sense of what it's like to have weight attached to your body is essential. Also 
                    to empathise with those people who have to carry extra weight due to basic needs or 
                    illnesses. <br><br>

                    Clearly, putting yourself in the situation of your object of study is not only 
                    beneficial for gaining first-hand knowledge of the context, but also brings spontaneous 
                    and unexpected knowledge that you cannot get from working externally. Also, by being 
                    the instrument yourself, you can empathise directly with your target and feel what 
                    they feel. In my case, as I was already under a lot of stress, having to carry weights 
                    was even more uncomfortable and tiring, which made me reflect even more on those people 
                    who have no other choice. I was also able to experience how some of the weights placed 
                    on my body had practically no effect on my mobility. <br><br>

                    On the other hand, after this workshop I think I will start working more in this way, 
                    but with more time and without recording myself. These two things are the ones that 
                    have interfered the most in my experience and I think that if I had carried out the 
                    experiment in other conditions it would have been more useful and enriching. Even so, 
                    looking to the future, I certainly think I'm going to explore more what it means to 
                    wear weights and I'm sure this will give me a clue as to where I need to go in the 
                    world of wearables and prosthetics. <br><br>

                    Finally, I feel that watching the experiences of my classmates has been a great 
                    opportunity to get to know them better, to learn from them and to find out what their 
                    interests and concerns are. Without a doubt, all of them are a source of inspiration 
                    and, although I can't name a specific person with whom I could collaborate on a 
                    thematic level, I would be delighted to be able to team up with any of them.
