                <p><strong>(21_november_2021)</strong><br><br>
                    This second week of Tech Beyond the Myth was devoted entirely to the workshop <strong>Almost 
                    Useless Machines</strong>. The aim of this workshop was to create a machine that was not very 
                    useful. A machine that was functional but not practical or useful in itself. It had to 
                    be an artefact created and thought from a feeling that we wanted to transmit to the user. <br><br>

                    At the beginning of this activity, the FabLab team showed us some of the projects from previous 
                    years so that we could have some reference of what we had to obtain at the end and of the 
                    possibilities of combining basic electronics with mechanics. They also gave us some 
                    recommendations on how to approach this project such as learning spiral development prototyping, 
                    using iterative design processes, maximizing uselessness with the minimum hardware, integrative 
                    design as a means of showing all the components in a beautiful way (by not hiding wires), 
                    minimalism, etc. <br>
                   
                </p>

                <div class="beside">

                        <p>
                        On the other hand we were also introduced to the Chindōgu concept, a Japanese concept that 
                        expresses an ingenious gadget that seems useful but in the end it causes more problems than 
                        it solves. <br><br>
                        
                        I would relate it to the current concept of "Life hacks" that is becoming so popular 
                        all over the world and where the absurdity of the products or the actions that are carried out 
                        border on nonsense. <br><br>

                <p>
                    My group, formed by Anna, Fiorella, Marina, Paula B., Rei and myself, decided to base 
                    our project on the emotions of desperation, anticipation and discomfort. In order to 
                    transmit these feelings, we thought of a machine that would give hugs but where the arms 
                    would never close nor would they ever touch the person they were theoretically hugging. 
                    A hug is a very comforting sensation, a warm contact and a sign of trust. In our case we
                    wanted to create a cold and opposite sensation to reality, where the person never felt 
                    comfortable or at ease. <br><br>

                    After that, we started to think about how this machine could work and how to achieve an 
                    attractive and minimalistic design. Besides, we were given some recycled components from 
                    other electronic devices (buttons, motor, infrared sensor) and we had to think how to 
                    integrate them into our device. From there, we made some first prototypes in cardboard to 
                    see how the structure of our robot would work and once we checked its feasibility we 
                    started to work on the final design. <br><br>

                    We divided up the different parts of the machine: arms, body, mechanism, electronics and 
                    code, and we discussed the advances and problems at each stage of the creation. It was 
                    really interesting to see how each of the parts was improving from the initial idea and 
                    how everything became more complex and at the same time more elaborated and visually attractive. 
                    In this presentation we show the whole construction process of the Hug Me Not machine: <br><br>

                    and also a close-up of the details, mechanisms and electronics: <br><br>

                <p>
                    To conclude this project, I believe it has been a truly enriching experience for all 
                    the knowledge it has given us all and for me personally. It has been a way to enhance 
                    our creativity in a collective way, where we all participated in the creation process 
                    of each of the parts. I think it is a very good idea in a situation like this to think 
                    about what you want to transmit first of all, and from there to develop the object. I 
                    will certainly start using this methodology in the future. <br><br>

                    I also found it very interesting to develop a machine that incorporated mechanical 
                    and electronic pairs in just 3 days. It has been one of the most intense weeks of the 
                    master so far but the fact of seeing how everything started to take shape and to work 
                    was a very gratifying feeling. I truly enjoyed being able to create a circuit and a 
                    code from scratch and to see how what at first is something virtual, becomes something 
                    real and physical. It was also great to be able to watch the creation process of the 
                    other groups in the class and see how everything was changing and evolving, from the 
                    prototypes to the final design. <br><br>

                    On the other hand, I was able to start collaborating with people from the class, 
                    something I had wanted to do for a long time, and I think that by combining our 
                    knowledge we were able to obtain an almost unbeatable result. Obviously everyone has 
                    their own way of working and sometimes you need a moment of sharing and talking things 
                    through, but the good thing is that we all have different qualities and where one 
                    doesn't reach, the other does. Sharing information and learning from each other is one 
                    of the most valuable things there is. <br><br>
