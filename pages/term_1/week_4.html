                        <p><strong>(31_october_2021)</strong><br><br>

                            This second science week led by Nuria Conde and Jonathan Minchin was 
                            dedicated almost exclusively to agriculture. It was an enriching experience 
                            because given my background, I had never worked or studied anything related 
                            to this sector. I had always been in the more industrial sphere without 
                            thinking about the basis of nature and where the food that keeps us alive 
                            comes from. <br><br>

                            It was also interesting to see the relationship between agriculture and 
                            cities. Currently there is a huge dependency of the cities on the agricultural 
                            fields as all the food that comes in comes from outside. Yet there does not 
                            seem to be a direct connection from the cities to who grows and cultivates 
                            the food, it is just never taken into account. A combination of technological 
                            improvements and a change of mentality towards non-overproduction and proximity 
                            farming would be the solution to try to improve the situation. <br><br>

                            Last but not least, I found the introduction to the world of bees certainly 
                            curious and useful also in other contexts, both in design and in societal 
                            structures (although I am a republican). I appreciated seeing the development 
                            of the beehives project in opensource format and all the work and prototypes 
                            behind the final construction. <br><br>

                        <p>
                            <STRONG><em>/ANALYSING_SOILS</em></STRONG><br>
                            The first activity we carried out consisted of analysing different types 
                            of soil according to a classification scheme that takes into account 
                            consistency, granularity, ability to form solid drips and colour. We used 
                            an app called Sqapp to differentiate the soil according to its shade and 
                            place of origin. We also test the nitrite and nitrate level of the soils, 
                            as well as the pH. <br><br>

                            <strong><em>/ESSENTIAL_OIL_EXTRACTION</em></strong><br>
                            The second activity was the creation of essential oils based on an oil 
                            extraction process using boiling water and a specific container. In this 
                            case, we extracted the oil from a laurel tree, using its leaves to extract 
                            a few millilitres. I found the process quite complex and long for 
                            the final result but it was really interesting to see the steps to be carried 
                            out and the thermodynamics necessary to obtain the essence of a plant. <br><br>

                            <strong><em>/CREATING_BIOPLASTICS</em></strong><br>
                            Finally, the activity on the last day of the course was about developing 
                            biomaterials based on different components in a short time. In my group, 
                            we used glycerol, distilled water, cornstarch and vinegar to form the 
                            bioplastic. All we needed to do was to mix it all together and then heat it 
                            on the burner until it solidified.
