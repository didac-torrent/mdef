                <h2>/weekSix.tech_beyond_the_myth.1</h2>
                <p><strong>(14_november_2021)</strong><br><br>

                    During this first week of Tech Beyond the Myth with Guillem Camprodon, Óscar 
                    González and Victor Barberán as facilitators, we have been working on two 
                    different topics: Forensics of the obsolescense and Measuring the world. The 
                    first one was an introduction to the current industrial model where most of the 
                    products have a supposed programmed obsolescence and where the supply chain has 
                    an important weight in the manufacture and composition of the products we use in 
                    our daily life. The second part was aimed at getting to know the world of data 
                    and working on the process of collecting data based on an objective, analysing 
                    the information collected and obtaining results. It was also a way to reflect 
                    on privacy and everything that involves the data we provide to large companies. <br><br>

                    To work on the concepts discussed in class, we held two workshops during the week. 
                    The first, on forensics of the obsolescense, was a one-day activity and the second, 
                    on measuring the world, took up the remaining three days. I will explain below what 
                    they consisted of and what the experience was like. <br><br>
                    
                </p>

                <h3><span>.forensics_of_the_obsolescence</span></h3>

                <p>
                    In this first workshop, we were divided into groups of 5-6 people and we chose 
                    one of the appliances and devices that the FabLab members had brought us. My 
                    group was formed by Angel, Audrey, Joaquin, Roberto and myself. We decided to 
                    choose the iRobot Roomba first generation, a well-known but at the same time uncommon product 
                    in our lives. Afterwards, we had to dismantle it completely, piece by piece, in 
                    order to analyse how the product works, to find out which part had stopped working 
                    and which was still working, to analyse the production chain and the origin of the 
                    parts, etc. <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    These are some of the conclusions from the forensic observation: <br>
                    
                    <div class="diagram">
                        - Reverse engineering the iRobot Roomba 500, we could identify several 
                    deficiencies with the design and the functionality of the automatic robotic vacuum 
                    cleaner. <br><br>
                    - As an initial observation, some components were not easily disassembled 
                    with a screwdriver and had to be torn manually. This prevents the possibility of repair 
                    past its original estimated product lifetime and relies on dependency to a central 
                    manufacturer. <br><br>
                    - Additionally, we noticed that despite its internal filtration components, 
                    dirt and debris managed to make their way inside the controller section where debris 
                    shouldn’t go. This could contribute to a rapid deterioration of the product. <br><br>
                    - The mechanics of the iRobot Roomba 500 lent themselves to a misuse of 
                    energy by following a random path of cleaning which would expend the rechargable battery 
                    at a faster rate than it would if it followed a more logical cleaning path. This shortened 
                    the lifespan of the rechargable battery considerably. <br><br>
                    </div>

                    This workshop was really interesting to understand how this appliance works but also 
                    to see the inside of other products such as a TV and a Mac. It was also useful to see 
                    the origin of the parts and how the manufacture of these products is the result of the 
                    work of many different countries. <br><br>

                <p>
                    In this second workshop we also divided into groups and started brainstorming 
                    about things we would like to change in our environment or in our lives. Our group, 
                    formed by Andrea, Kai, Rei, Ruben and myself, focused on two main ideas: IAAC 
                    facilities and street life. Around these two concepts there were many other issues 
                    such as the lack of rubbish to recycle in the classroom or the fact that we couldn't 
                    eat inside the facilities, and on the other hand the bad smell of some streets in 
                    Barcelona or the fact that people don't always pick up dog poop. <br><br>

                    Finally we decided to focus on the fact that you can't eat inside IAAC and we set 
                    the goal "I want to eat inside IAAC". From here, we started to think of questions 
                    that would serve as the basis of our data collection, taking into account the factors 
                    that affect our main objective. We chose the question "Is there a space for a 
                    (covid-safe) lunch?" and later on we also added another one related to people: 
                    "Are there people in Iaac interested in having a space to have lunch?". <br><br>

                    After we had the hypothesis, the FabLab members gave each group a tool to collect 
                    information. To distribute them, we did a reverse auction where each group gave 
                    arguments about the tools that could work for the other groups. The PiCamera was 
                    finally the tool that we ended up keeping, as both we and the other groups thought 
                    it was the best way to get information about our topic. <br><br>

                </p>
        
                <div class="img2">
                    <img src="../../images/data2.png" width="900px">
                </div>

                <p>

                    From there we started to think about how we could collect information only with 
                    the camera and what form would give us the most accurate data and we created a 
                    strategy for action. <br><br>

                    For more information about the intervention you can go directly to the page where 
                    the whole process is explained. Here you can also see the data collected and the 
                    analysis of the results: <br>

                    As a conclusion of this experiment, we believe that we could not obtain all the 
                    necessary information to solve our problem due to two main factors: time and tools. 
                    We also had some problems with the PiCamera that made us lose some recordings that 
                    could be important for our research. Still, thinking about how the intervention would 
                    have to be in order to be able to collect the data in an optimal way also helped 
                    a lot to understand how this whole process works and what are the most appropriate 
                    conditions and paths to take. <br><br>
