                <p id="one">Throughout this week we have been working on the basis of the Atlas of 
                    Week Signals and exploring its possibilities. Weak signals are those emerging topics, 
                    problems or subjects that have a significant impact on today's world. The aim of this 
                    course was to introduce us to this Atlas to then analyse in a hyper-local way a 
                    specific context, through Design Spaces and a Multi-scalar diagram (starting from the 
                    "me" to the global scope of the matter).

                <h3><span>.my_design_space</span></h3>
                <p id="one">
                    After the introductory session, Mariana took us to Collserola for a short hike from 
                    the Mundet university campus to one of the viewpoints along this small mountain range. 
                    The purpose of this walk was to gain perspective of our surroundings and to meditate 
                    on the theme of the Atlas we had chosen. In my case, it was also an occasion to 
                    remember old times, as we passed in front of the school where I had studied during 
                    my childhood.

                <p id="one">
                    In my case, I decided to focus my Design Space on three weak signals: Rural Futures, 
                    Long-Terminism and Technology for Equality. I chose these concepts because I believe 
                    there is a direct relationship between them and they are subjects that have always 
                    interested me. <br><br>
                    Rural areas do not have the same resources as big cities, and the same goes for 
                    technology. There are no FabLabs or Ateneus outside urban areas, so it is very 
                    unlikely that anyone can learn about digital fabrication and the maker world without 
                    access to the necessary resources. So, taking into account the emigration from the 
                    cities caused by the pandemic, the telecommuting and the current need to live in open 
                    spaces, I thought it would be a good option to move these resources to rural locations 
                    as well. Then the technologies could be combined with the tools and needs of the 
                    particular environament.

                    Apart from the main Design Space, I also created another one with my current technical 
                    interests and with references to other projects related to the weak signals I chose. <br><br>
                    As for my fight, I think there is a direct connection between the proposal of my Design 
                    Space and the concepts I defined in my poster: empathy, innovation, social sphere, etc.

                <h3><span>.multi-scalar_diagram</span></h3>
                <p id="one">
                    In this Multi-Scalar diagram I tried to mix the two Design Spaces I had created, 
                    placing the different ideas in the scale to which they corresponded. It was not 
                    very easy to know where to situate some concepts given that the repercussion of 
                    these ideas is sometimes abstract and undefined. Even so, it was a useful exercise 
                    to imagine how the themes raised in the Design Space affect the different levels 
                    of communities.

                <p id="one">
                    I was part of the Post-consumerism and State Futures Collaborative Design Spaces 
                    and it was a great opportunity to get to know the vision of my classmates and 
                    their Design Spaces and try to relate the concepts that each of us had created 
                    separately. As expected, the fact that we were working on similar themes meant that 
                    many ideas were interrelated and there were points in common. Even so, the knowledge 
                    contributed by each one of us made this Collaborative Design Space wider and took into 
                    account many points of view that otherwise would not have been included.
