                <p><strong>(22_december_2021)</strong><br><br>
                    
                    The last two weeks of this first trimester were focused on the preparation of the 
                    Design Dialogues event. The idea for the eleventh week was to hold the Design for 
                    the Next Billion Seconds course but it had to be postponed, which gave us more time 
                    to develop the content we were going to present at the exhibition. <br><br>

                    On the other hand, we finally had the opportunity to visit a very special place that 
                    we were very curious about: Valldaura Labs. Valldaura Labs are some land and buildings 
                    that IAAC has in the Collserola mountain range where different activities are carried 
                    out and also a master's degree in which students stay in the rural house throughout the 
                    year. <br><br>
                </p>

                <div class="beside">

                    <div>
                        <h3><span>.valldaura_field_trip</span></h3>
                        <p>

                            The excursion to Valldaura Labs was a truly satisfying and inspiring experience. We 
                            were lucky enough to enjoy spring weather in the middle of December and that helped 
                            us to contemplate the beauty of these forest and mountain environments. Although close 
                            to Barcelona, the truth is that once you get lost in the little paths of Collserola 
                            you get the impression of being completely isolated, and the location of the rural 
                            house that IAAC has is simply perfect for developing the work and projects on which 
                            they focus. <br><br>

                            During the visit, Jonathan, Philip and a second year MAEBB student presented the 
                            different projects that had been carried out in recent years, such as the Solar 
                            Greenhouse, a small house for growing plants and cuttings, fully equipped with 
                            automatic irrigation and lights, and with a simply excellent design and finish. 
                            It was an inspiration to see the work done in just one year and to admire every 
                            single detail. <br><br>

                            We also had the opportunity to visit the outside of the Niu Haus, the project of 
                            the first edition of the master's course, which consists of a completely habitable 
                            house, with two floors including a dining room, kitchen, bathroom and a bed. Another 
                            truly spectacular work. <br><br>

                <p>
                    We also visited the interior of the building and saw the different spaces where wood, 
                    the main material used in the construction of Valldaura Labs, is worked. In fact, the 
                    wood comes directly from the Valldaura forests, which makes it even more special. We 
                    were able to see many different machines for each of the tasks and admire the spaces 
                    (honestly very well kept) of the Masia de Valldaura. <br><br>

                    Finally, we did a bit of farming in the cultivated land of the area, while enjoying 
                    the splendid day and the good company of our classmates. <br><br>

                <p>
                    In the eleventh week we started to prepare the necessary material for the Design 
                    Dialogues exhibition. The main objective of this event was to be able to show our 
                    progress and work done during this first trimester while collecting feedback and 
                    ideas from our fellow students and also from other invited people such as faculties, 
                    alumni and students from other masters. <br><br>

                    In my case, the preparation focused mainly on the <a href="https://plant-b.io" id="hype"><strong>Plant B</strong></a> project (which you can see 
                    on the Design Studio sessions page), which was our Collective Design Intervention, 
                    as I had no other relevant content to show for the moment. Of course, for the next 
                    Design Dialogues I expect it will be very different as I will finally have been able 
                    to experience more first hand and develop more content to show. I also designed a new 
                    poster of my fight which you can find <a href="../term_1/studio.html" id="hype"><strong>here</strong></a>. <br><br>

                    The fact of doing this event was really instructive and it was also a point of 
                    connection and interaction with my fellow masters where we could finally talk a bit 
                    and explain to each other what we had been doing these months and what our interests 
                    were for the future. It was very interesting to get to know the interventions of the 
                    other people and the work they have been developing on their own, and without a doubt 
                    the fact of giving feedback to each other is very important to be able to grow and see 
                    different points of view and options for the future. <br><br>
