                        <strong>(16_january_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    
                        This week we had the pleasure of assisting to a talk from Audrey Desjardins, 
                        an Industrial Designer and Researcher from Canada, currently teaching at University of 
                        Washington, Seattle. <br><br>

                        Audrey has worked a lot with design as a mode of inquiry. She thinks design needs to 
                        provoke a relfection and it has to be focused on asking questions, not only solving 
                        problems. She is also an enthusiast of all the first person methods, as she believes 
                        this is the best way to get to know the reality of what you are studying. <br><br>

                        During the talk, Audrey explained some of the projects she had been working on lately, and 
                        two of them more in depth: 'Living in a prototype' and 'The odd interpreters'.  <br><br>

                        The first one consisted of all the process of building a house inside a van and using this 
                        as a data collection method. They took pictures of each step, timelapses and used a travel 
                        diary to collect data, and then they published the whole project on Instructables. She defined 
                        it as an dutobiographical design. <br><br>

                        <img src="../../images/van1.jpg" alt="Van" width="700px"> <br><br>

                        For the second one was directly related to data collection but in an experimental way. It 
                        was a manner of physically showing how data is flowing all around us, not only in a digital 
                        meaning but also in an environmental meaning (like the sun). <br><br>

                        Having the chance of getting to know all these projects it's not only interesting but also 
                        extremely useful. Once you see the process of others, then you can get inspired and maybe 
                        use some techniques or procedures also for your own work. Thanks Audrey for this masterclass 
                        of design! <br><br>

                <h2>/laura_forlano</h2>

                    <p><strong>(30_january_2022)</strong><br><br>
                        This second session of Future Talks was carried out by Laura Forlano, a writer, social scientist 
                        and design researcher, currently working at IIT Institute of Design (Chicago). <br><br>

                        Laura told us her experience of being diabetic since 2018 and how this has changed completely her 
                        life. She explained how now her life depends on an AI device that keeps her alive by pushing insulin 
                        through her veins when it is needed. Also how she had some trouble sleeping because her old device 
                        was sending her notifications all the time, inclusively during the night. The fact of waking up every 
                        15-30 minutes because of the notification had as a consequence a severe sleep deprivation, with 
                        the inherent results. <br><br>

                        Now, she has another device that is much more efficient called "The MiniMed 670G". Thanks to 
                        technological advances, this device automatically adds the necessary quantity of insulin by analysing 
                        sugar in the blood. This improvement makes it unnecessary to send notifications every 20 minutes. 
                        However, she reflected, tech is not perfect and probably will never be, so we have to choose when to 
                        disobey tech's rules. <br><br>

                        As a design researcher, she sees theory as design material, and this is why she explores theories 
                        of the posthuman, questioning the binaries and fighting also for feminism. She is also enthusiastic 
                        about autoethnography in design and using a vignette as a way of documenting. <br><br>

                        Finally, Oscar highlighted another slide she shared about 'What if' questions. Asking yourself 
                        'What if' directly brings you to create a hypothesis of something that could happen. Without these 
                        kinds of questions, there wouldn't be improvements in many topics and probably everything would stay 
                        the same. Mixing these questions with a subsequent intervention or experiment may provide very 
                        valuable information from a topic. <br><br>

                    <h2>/sergio_urueña</h2>

                    <p><strong>(13_february_2022)</strong><br><br>
                        The first talk of Future Talks was carried out by Sergio Urueña, an interdisciplinary scholar 
                        focused on philosophy in relation to science. As a researcher, he was exploring deeply the 
                        relation of technology with society and how both things define how the future will be. <br><br>

                        Sergio described two ways of defining the future: technological determinism and social 
                        constructionism. In the first approach, tech is what defines how the future will be, so society 
                        changes according to new technological discoverings and advances (or failures). In the second one, 
                        society evolves separately from tech and people is who define how the future will be without 
                        taking into account other factors. However, both of these theories are quite radical and each one 
                        has positive but also negative aspects, this is why a better approach would be the socio-technical 
                        one, in which both tech and society have the same importance. <br><br>

                        <img src="../../images/sergio1.jpg" alt="Classroom" width="700px"> <br><br>

                        He also talked about responsibility regarding the future, and how every action has a consequence. 
                        He said a really interesting sentence "People don't know what what-they-do does". I think this is 
                        a certain reality in our society, where we consume massively and this has catastrophic consequences. 
                        The ones who created this system didn't know how this could end. Also, on a smaller scale, we as 
                        designers need to think about the cycle of life of our products in order not to collaborate on this 
                        huge mass of trash existing on our planet. And this refers to many other projects and stuff we do in 
                        our daily lives. <br><br>

                        Finally, Sergio also left us some questions we should take into consideration when developing our 
                        projects. All the questions referred to responsibility towards the planet and the communities we are 
                        designing for, as well as how can we engage with people and make our projects worthy and meaningful. 
                        For sure they are a good way to reflect and to take our projects further in meaning and form. <br><br>

                        The last session of Future Talks was carried out by Saúl Baeza, a creator and design researcher 
                        based in l'Hospitalet de Llobregat. He is the director of DOES Work, a design consultancy with the 
                        aim of exploring those things related to identity on any scale. He is also participating in VISIONS 
                        BY magazine and in Understanding Design, an association focused on the possibilities of contemporary 
                        design. <br><br>

                        Throughout the talk, Saúl introduced us to some of the projects he and his company have been carrying 
                        out during the last years. The first one he showed was a really interesting project called 
                        <a href="https://www.does-work.com/projects/unicef-does-a-time-machine" id="hype" target="_blank"><strong>Time Machine</strong></a> 
                        for UNICEF and in collaboration with Domestic Data Streamers, where they interacted with 
                        people and played with the concept of time in many different areas. It was not just an installation 
                        but a huge interdisciplinary experience for the users. <br><br>

                        He presented some other projects such as one where they collected body hair and used it as part of 
                        the material to build objects or an experiment carried out by himself where he was wearing different 
                        masks while analysing people's reactions to seeing him. For this second one, I liked what he said 
                        "Hiding your identity can make you easier to identify" in relation to the masks he was wearing. <br><br>

                        At the end of the talk, I asked him if all those projects usually get further or if all that stays 
                        as design research. He answered many of the projects are just for the sake of research and 
                        investigation and that they are not trying to take them further, they don't want to start creating a 
                        business or a company selling products, they explore design because they like it. Finally, he said: 
                        "I'm young and I want to keep exploring, at least for some time more, then we will see". And I 
                        completely agree with those words. <br><br>
