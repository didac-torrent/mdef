                            This week we had the pleasure of assisting to a talk from Audrey Desjardins, 
                            an Industrial Designer and Researcher from Canada, currently teaching at University of 
                            Washington, Seattle. <br><br>

                            Audrey has worked a lot with design as a mode of inquiry. She thinks design needs to 
                            provoke a relfection and it has to be focused on asking questions, not only solving 
                            problems. She is also an enthusiast of all the first person methods, as she believes 
                            this is the best way to get to know the reality of what you are studying. 
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="img6">
                        <img src="../../images/van1.png" width="400px">
                    </div>

                </div>

                <p>
                    During the talk, Audrey explained some of the projects she had been working on lately, and 
                    two of them more in depth: 'Living in a prototype' and 'The odd interpreters'.  <br><br>

                    The first one consisted of all the process of building a house inside a van and using this 
                    as a data collection method. They took pictures of each step, timelapses and used a travel 
                    diary to collect data, and then they published the whole project on Instructables. She defined 
                    it as an dutobiographical design. <br><br>

                    For the second one was directly related to data collection but in an experimental way. It 
                    was a manner of physically showing how data is flowing all around us, not only in a digital 
                    meaning but also in an environmental meaning (like the sun). <br><br>

                    Having the chance of getting to know all these projects it's not only interesting but also 
                    extremely useful. Once you see the process of others, then you can get inspired and maybe 
                    use some techniques or procedures also for your own work. Thanks Audrey for this masterclass 
                    of design! <br><br>
