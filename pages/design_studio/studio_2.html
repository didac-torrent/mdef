                <p id="one"><strong>(23_january_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    
                    The first session of this second term Design Studio was an introduction to what we will be 
                    doing and working on. Mariana and Oscar presented to us the structure for the sessions and 
                    the main objective for this term: "Take a further step into our projects, focusing on finding 
                    and growing our communities of practice and developing interventions in the real world". As 
                    they explained, now is not a moment to explore different topics anymore as we did during the 
                    first term, but a moment to start building the real foundations of our project. <br><br>

                    Mariana also gave us some tips for this term regarding the project: work with other people, 
                    document for you and for others, not to think about failure, perfection or feeling lost, keep 
                    reflecting, commit to your values and let the project flow. I think all these recommendations 
                    are of a high value, they help one understand and take perspective. <br><br>

                    Finally, Oscar talked about decision making and being reflective of why do things happen. 
                    Taking a look back one can figure many things out and this can lead to acting differently in 
                    the future. At class, each of us commented 3 things we had done differently compared to past 
                    projects and I found really interesting seeing how we are all getting out of our comfort zone
                    and exploring different ways of working. So, related to that, our task for this week is a 
                    reflection about everything that has happened so far or, in other words, a summary of our 
                    journey until now. This is the result of this deep reflection: <br><br>

                    On the other hand, for the task fo this week we were asked to update our Design Space and 
                    add all the important information for this second semester. In my case, I restructured the whole
                    space, connecting different ideas I'm interested in and also adding more resources and communities 
                    I can work with. In this updated Design Space I also added all the interventions and experiments
                    I have been working on so far, and also started thinking of the next actions I can do towards
                    my project. <br><br>

                <h2>/intervention_on_the_street</h2>

                <p><strong>(06_february_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    The last session of Design Studio put the main focus on the realisation of interventions and 
                    actively experimenting with embodied actions related to our topics. Oscar emphasised the words 
                    from Laura Forlano about "What if..." questions (you can check the summary of the talk <a href="../../pages/design_studio/future_talks.html" id="hype"><strong>here</strong></a>), that 
                    provoke an instantaneous need of answering by doing something to prove it. <br><br>

                    Furthermore, Mariana showed some examples of what an intervention could be beyond a workshop, 
                    such as co-designing, documenting new habits, designing an experience or a methodology, etc. She 
                    also presented some interventions from the last year, every single one different from each other, 
                    to give us some ideas of what our interventions could be. <br><br>

                    In my case, I have started some interventions in parallel related to the main subjects I am 
                    interested in: generative design, trash and object mutation. The one that I have been focused on 
                    the most and that I'm presenting this week is the one below. <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3><span>.checking_the_trash</span></h3>

                <p>
                    This intervention had the aim of getting to know what every day gets thrown on the streets of 
                    Barcelona. I have been wanting to work with trash for a while now but I still didn't know which 
                    kind of objects, furniture, devices, materials I would be able to find on the streets during the 
                    trash collection day. <br><br>

                    During the last weeks, I have been checking the map of recollection for each neighbourhood and 
                    have been walking around looking for the things people left on the street. Apart from the objects 
                    themselves, I also wanted to see the differences between each neighbourhood concerning the quality 
                    of the objects and their state, the amount, the style (old-fashioned or modern), etc. This is the 
                    documentation from the intervention: <br><br>
                </p>

                    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/674863866?h=f3fecf9235&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479"

                <p>
                    After this intervention, I got to some conclusions regarding the trash on the streets: <br>

                    <div class="diagram">
                        - There is a huge amount of objects thrown in each neighbourhood every single day. <br><br>
                        - Objects thrown are generally made out of wood or wood conglomerates. There's people 
                        who take the metal parts from the objects. There aren't many plastics or other materials. <br><br>
                        - Almost every object thrown is furniture like chairs, wardrobes, benches, beds, etc. There 
                        aren't many electronic devices nor household appliances. <br><br>
                        - The things thrown in each neighbourhood are not really different from each other. The zone 
                        of the city apparently doesn't affect the style of trash. <br><br>
