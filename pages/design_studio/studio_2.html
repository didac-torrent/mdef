                    The first session of this second term Design Studio was an introduction to what we will be 
                    doing and working on. Mariana and Oscar presented to us the structure for the sessions and 
                    the main objective for this term: "Take a further step into our projects, focusing on finding 
                    and growing our communities of practice and developing interventions in the real world". As 
                    they explained, now is not a moment to explore different topics anymore as we did during the 
                    first term, but a moment to start building the real foundations of our project. <br><br>

                    Mariana also gave us some tips for this term regarding the project: work with other people, 
                    document for you and for others, not to think about failure, perfection or feeling lost, keep 
                    reflecting, commit to your values and let the project flow. I think all these recommendations 
                    are of a high value, they help one understand and take perspective. <br><br>

                    Finally, Oscar talked about decision making and being reflective of why do things happen. 
                    Taking a look back one can figure many things out and this can lead to acting differently in 
                    the future. At class, each of us commented 3 things we had done differently compared to past 
                    projects and I found really interesting seeing how we are all getting out of our comfort zone
                    and exploring different ways of working. So, related to that, our task for this week is a 
                    reflection about everything that has happened so far or, in other words, a summary of our 
                    journey until now. This is the result of this deep reflection: <br><br>

                            This week we also had the pleasure of assisting to a talk from Audrey Desjardins, 
                            an Industrial Designer and Researcher from Canada, currently teaching at University of 
                            Washington, Seattle. <br><br>

                            Audrey has worked a lot with design as a mode of inquiry. She thinks design needs to 
                            provoke a relfection and it has to be focused on asking questions, not only solving 
                            problems. She is also an enthusiast of all the first person methods, as she believes 
                            this is the best way to get to know the reality of what you are studying.

                <p>
                    During the talk, Audrey explained some of the projects she had been working on lately, and 
                    two of them more in depth: 'Living in a prototype' and 'The odd interpreters'.  <br><br>

                    The first one consisted of all the process of building a house inside a van and using this 
                    as a data collection method. They took pictures of each step, timelapses and used a travel 
                    diary to collect data, and then they published the whole project on Instructables. She defined 
                    it as an dutobiographical design. <br><br>

                    For the second one was directly related to data collection but in an experimental way. It 
                    was a manner of physically showing how data is flowing all around us, not only in a digital 
                    meaning but also in an environmental meaning (like the sun). <br><br>

                    Having the chance of getting to know all these projects it's not only interesting but also 
                    extremely useful. Once you see the process of others, then you can get inspired and maybe 
                    use some techniques or procedures also for your own work. Thanks Audrey for this masterclass 
                    of design! <br><br>
