                    The first session of this second term Design Studio was an introduction to what we will be 
                    doing and working on. Mariana and Oscar presented to us the structure for the sessions and 
                    the main objective for this term: "Take a further step into our projects, focusing on finding 
                    and growing our communities of practice and developing interventions in the real world". As 
                    they explained, now is not a moment to explore different topics anymore as we did during the 
                    first term, but a moment to start building the real foundations of our project. <br><br>

                    Mariana also gave us some tips for this term regarding the project: work with other people, 
                    document for you and for others, not to think about failure, perfection or feeling lost, keep 
                    reflecting, commit to your values and let the project flow. I think all these recommendations 
                    are of a high value, they help one understand and take perspective. <br><br>

                    Finally, Oscar talked about decision making and being reflective of why do things happen. 
                    Taking a look back one can figure many things out and this can lead to acting differently in 
                    the future. At class, each of us commented 3 things we had done differently compared to past 
                    projects and I found really interesting seeing how we are all getting out of our comfort zone
                    and exploring different ways of working. So, related to that, our task for this week is a 
                    reflection about everything that has happened so far or, in other words, a summary of our 
                    journey until now. This is the result of this deep reflection: <br><br>
