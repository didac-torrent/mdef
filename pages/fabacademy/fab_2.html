                <p> <strong>(08_february_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    This second week of FabAcademy was focused on 2D and 3D design. We started learning about 
                    the difference between a vector and a raster image, resolutions on websites and for printing, 
                    diverse image formats (PNG, JPEG, RAW, etc.) and colour spectrums like CMYK or RGB. After, this 
                    introduction to the 2D and graphics universe, we were taught about different useful programs for 
                    2D design and edition. As a designer, I have already used many of them: I normally use Illustrator 
                    and Inkscape for vector design and Photoshop for image edition. Still, I discovered some I didn't 
                    know like Pixelr and Vectr, and both seem to be interesting and enjoyable. <br><br>

                    Secondly, we changed from 2D to 3D and started talking about the differences between Meshes and 
                    Nurbs. Then they exemplified those differences using some programs as examples: FlatDab, Fusion 
                    360, Rhinoceros, SolidWorks, etc. Finally, Eduardo also made a small introduction to Generative 
                    Design, a topic which I'm interested in and that I want to experiment with and use in my future 
                    projects. <br><br>

                    The session finished with a nice introduction to Blender carried out by Victor, who is an expert 
                    on this program. I've always thought this is an interesting program as well as difficult and scary. 
                    However, knowing what's behind the whole project and the way it works is quite interesting and 
                    encouraging. I'll certainly explore the possibilities of it in the future. <br><br>

                            The task for this week was had two main goals: modelling in 3D and designing in 2D. We had to 
                            model a shape related to our projects, create renderings of it and then design a poster including 
                            the render but also some vectorial drawings and raster images. <br><br>

                            In my case, I used Fusion 360 to model a wheel composed of three elements: the attachment part, 
                            the wheel body and the tires. Then assembled them and opened the whole assembly on Keyshot to create 
                            the renderings of it. Afterwards, I used Illustrator to create the poster: I made the drawing of a 
                            pallet with vectors, then added some text and finally included also a raster image from the FabLab. <br><br>

                            As you can see, the main topic of the poster is about giving a second life to objects, that is the 
                            topic I'm focused on, and the wheel is just a way of repairing and redesigning a pallet that is 
                            obsolete. <br><br>
