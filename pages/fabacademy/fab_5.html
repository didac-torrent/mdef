                <h2>/3D_printing_&_scanning</h2>

                <p><strong>(01_march_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    This week's topic of FabAcademy was 3D printing and scanning. During the theoretical class, the 
                    FabLab team explained a bit the story of 3D printing, starting from the first SLA printers and 
                    the RepRap project until nowadays where there are 3D printers for literally everything. They 
                    also explained the functioning of the main 3D printing technologies (FDM, SLA, SLS, DLP) and 
                    the materials that are normally used in each of them. <br><br>

                    Secondly, we were told about how to slice a 3D modelled part to have the optimal result. Many 
                    parameters have a direct effect on the final printed part such as layer height, infill, 
                    directionality, shell, etc. It's necessary to set a proper configuration for each part, using a 
                    slicing program like Cura, PrusaSlicer, Simplify3D or others. For that, you need to have the part 
                    in a mesh format that can be STL, OBJ or 3MF generally. <br><br>

                    <img src="../../images/printers1.jpg" width="700px"> <br><br>

                    After reviewing some other technologies for 3D printing and many techniques and materials, it was 
                    the turn of 3D scanning. FabLab team made a short introduction to the meaning of 3D scanning and 
                    then they proceeded to show us some ways of doing it using diverse programs and methods. One can 
                    scan either with a depth sensor or a LiDAR or using a technique called photogrammetry, where one 
                    takes hundreds of pictures of an object or a place from different angles and then a program puts 
                    them all together and creates the volume. In class, we also tried to scan with a Kinect sensor 
                    (from Xbox) using software called Scannect to create the mesh. <br><br>

                    In the afternoon, we had an explanation on paste 3D printing, a topic which I'm quite interested 
                    in since it is the one I have explored the least until now. They have modified an Ender-3 to be 
                    able to print with any kind of paste such as clay or whatever that can stand up after being printed. 
                    They showed the mechanism used and the slicing program, that was created with Grasshopper. Then we 
                    printed a vase with mashed potatoes to test it.  <br><br>

                <p>
                    The task for this week was pretty clear: 3D print something that you have designed that can only 
                    be built with additive manufacturing techniques. Simplifying, something with complex shapes or 
                    patterns that would be difficult to do with injection, CNC or else. <br><br>

                    In my case, I decided to keep exploring a topic that I'm interested in: generative design with 
                    Fusion 360. I modelled 8 cylinders split into two planes and applied some forces (a bit random) 
                    that would be there in case we used this part as a joint. <br><br>

                    <img src="../../images/generated1.png" width="700px"> <br><br><br>
                    
                    Then the program started creating 
                    iterations and alternatives in the design and I finally chose the one below, that isn't way too 
                    thick nor way too thin. <br><br>
                                    
                    <div>

                    </div> <br><br>
                    
                    Luckily, I have an FDM and a DLP printer at home so, even being confined I could test to print 
                    the design I made. I sliced the part in Cura for the FDM printer and in Lychee for the DLP printer, 
                    setting the necessary supports and other configurations for each. I printed the part in both 
                    technologies to check the differences in appearance, strength and complexity. For the FDM I used 
                    PLA and for the DLP Water Washable resin. These are some pictures of the process: <br><br>

                    <img src="../../images/generated2.png" width="700px"> <br><br>

                    Finally, I cleaned the support structures and tested gently the strength of both parts. Thanks to 
                    producing these two parts I learnt quite a lot about generative design and now I know some tips 
                    and tricks that will help me for the next design. Also, I like better the result obtained with the 
                    resin printer since it's more accurate, the surface is much softer and even having many supports, 
                    they are much easier to remove than with the FDM printer. It was also faster to print. However, 
                    the resin is more expensive, the process of cleaning everything is a bit tough and it produces 
                    strong gases that are quite toxic. I guess every process has its pros and cons. This is the final 
                    result of both parts: <br><br><br>

                <h3><span>.scanning_with_meshroom</span></h3> <br>

                <p>
                    As a bonus, I wanted to explore the possibilities of Meshroom, an open software for photogrammetry 
                    with a lot of options and great performance. I chose an organic object, in this case a 40cm tall 
                    log, and prepared an appropiate scene to take the pictures: no direct light, a monochromatic 
                    background and the fewer interferences possible. Then I started taking pictures from every angle 
                    using different techniques. I took approximately 120 pictures of the log and imported them to 
                    Meshroom.  <br><br><br>
                    
                    <img src="../../images/log1.jpeg" width="700px"> <br><br>

                    Inside the program, I had some issues that I finally solved. The first one was to have the pictures 
                    in a folder that contained non-ASCII characters. The second one was because my computer didn't 
                    have CUDA GPU form nvidia and this didn't allow me to create a Depth. However, by changing some 
                    of the connections from the tree, I managed to create the mesh anyway, maybe with a bit less of 
                    detail since the Depth Map couldn't be created, but still with a pretty amazing result. It also 
                    created the texture of the log from the pictures. <br><br>

                    <img src="../../images/log3.gif" width="700px"> <br><br>

                    This is the map Meshroom created automatically from the pictures I imported. It is easy to
                    see the dome I made with my movements while taking pictures, targeting the log all the time. I was really
                    impressed to see how easily the program could locate each picture in space. It is not hard to see how
                    well developed this programme is. <br><br>

                    <div class="img4">
                    <img src="../../images/log2.png" width="900px"> <br><br>
                    </div>

                    Finally, I used Meshmixer to delete the part of the model that I didn't want (the blanket) and 
                    fill mesh holes. After this, I obtained the final mesh of the log, with a suprisingly great 
                    resolution and quality. I was amazed about how easy was to use this program and the quality of 
                    the output mesh, also with its texture. In about two hours you could get a high fildelity 
                    mesh ready to be printed or else. Without a doubt, I want to keep exploring photogrammetry 
                    with Meshroom, scanning other objects from different sizes and also people, and then playing 
                    with the mesh. <br><br>
