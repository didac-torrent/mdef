                <h2>/MICROCHALLENGE_3</h2>

                <p><strong>(06_may_2022)</strong><br><br>

                    target="_blank">OVERLOAD</a>. <br><br>

                    For this third Microchallenge, I teamed up with Aparna and Nikita with the idea of creating something 
                    in relation to social networks and how to represent the influence they have on us. The concepts to 
                    take into consideration for the challenge were electronics regarding inputs and outputs, creating an 
                    interface, networking and design ethics. <br><br><br>

                    <img src="../../images/overload_logo1.png" width="700px"> <br><br><br>

                    From the topic of social networks, we started thinking about how to visually and physically represent 
                    how using all the typical apps affect us in our daily lives. We had to discuss this for a while since 
                    every one of us had different views and thoughts regarding the topic: from being influenced by the 
                    stereotypes shown in media, to the superficiality of what people show in media, to how the time we 
                    spend on our mobile phones makes us feel attached and trapped sometimes. <br><br>

                    We finally decided to create a representation that could show all these feelings, based on the 
                    concept of an inflatable that could grow to represent all these thoughts that grow in our minds 
                    when we use these kinds of apps. We thought of different shapes but in the end, we chose a neck 
                    brace because we believed it was really explicit: something that inflates in the neck that chokes, 
                    that restricts the movement of the head, that is attached to you like a chain. These are some 
                    drawings of the concept and some references: <br><br><br>

                    <img src="../../images/sketches1.png" width="700px"> <br><br><br>

                    <img src="../../images/references1.png" width="700px"> <br><br><br>

                    The concept was that people had to use an interface we created to share the time they had spent 
                    on social networks and then the wearable neck brace inflated in relation to the time. The more 
                    time, the more the neck brace would inflate and choke.  <br><br>

                    Here we divided the tasks and meanwhile Nikita was developing the communication of the project 
                    and the code in P5, Aparna and I started prototyping the inflatable thanks to a <a id="hype" href="https://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/barcelona/students/javier-alboguijarro/week16.html" 
                    target="_blank">project</a> Dafni shared with us. We used organic trash bags and the laser cutter to seal the two layers and to cut 
                    the external shape of the inflatable. We made many tests to adjust the settings of the laser: <br><br>

                    <div class="img4">
                        <img src="../../images/inflatables1.jpg" width="900px">
                    </div> <br><br>                  

                    Also, I prepared the whole electronic part and soldered some cables from the power source to the 
                    air pump and used a relay to make it able to communicate with the ESP32. <br><br>

                    After this, we decided on the final form of the wearable and looked for a long tube to connect the 
                    inflatable to the air pump. We also designed a box for the electronics and then we already had the 
                    whole physical device fabricated and ready to use. This is how the wearable looked in the end: <br><br><br>

                    On the other hand, we worked on the storytelling of the project, we called it Overload in relation 
                    to the huge amount of information we get from social networks and Nikita developed a website for 
                    the project that explained it well and also created a 3D environment to show how this wearable would 
                    look if everyone was wearing it on the streets. <br><br>

                    This part was complementary to the physical device and gave the project a bit more background and 
                    meaning. It also further showed the concept we wanted to represent. You can access to the website

                    Finally, I also want to mention that this challenge has also a direct relation to my project in the 
                    sense that we feel physically more than we usually do. I'm focusing on wearables that can extend 
                    our perceptions, and this was a clear way to make us physically feel things that, in a normal 
                    situation, we wouldn't feel. Also, the fact of extending human capabilities, in this challenge 
                    turned into restricting human capabilities. Seeing it the other way around was at least fascinating. <br><br>
