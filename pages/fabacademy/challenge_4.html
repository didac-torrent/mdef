                <h2>/MICROCHALLENGE_4</h2>

                <p><strong>(03_june_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    You can check the whole project by tapping here: <a id="hype" href="https://github.com/philippa-Formosa/Microchallenge-4/blob/main/README.md" 
                    target="_blank">SFEEL</a>. <br><br>

                    To develop this fourth and last challenge, I teamed up with Pippa and Borka. We all had in mind to 
                    create some tool that could get information from the environment. The concept moved around a gamified 
                    audiovisual system, to capture the different perceptions of different environments. Capturing 
                    movements, sounds and sensing of materials. Visualizing the movements of the body in space, and the 
                    connection with different materials in the natural or built environment. <br><br>

                    We agreed to give that tool the shape of a ball that could have all the sensors needed inside (touch 
                    sensor, gyroscope, microphone, etc.). This form allowed us to move the device around in a really 
                    interactive and intuitive way for any kind of public, from kids to the elderly. This is a sketch of 
                    the concept: <br><br><br>

                    <div class="img4">
                        <img src="../../images/sfeelsketch.jpg" width="900px">
                    </div> <br><br> 

                    The operation of this tool would be the following: Use the different sensors to get data from the 
                    environment, then use Serial communication to send all the values to P5 and finally create a visual 
                    representation (either functional or abstract) of the data. Basically, we wanted to have this visual 
                    input from movements, touches and sounds that we normally get from a camera but without needing one. 
                    Also, we wanted to turn that data into something more artistic and less pragmatic. <br><br><br>

                    After defining the concept, we started with the fabrication by splitting the tasks. Since we were 
                    combining many different technologies and processes, we had to work side by side and organise 
                    ourselves in the best possible way. The tasks were the following: <br><br>                 

                    <div class="diagram">
                        - 3D design and model the structure of the ball and the internal components. <br><br>
                        - Slice and 3D print every part. <br><br>
                        - Create the moulds for the different material samples. Each material had a different procedure (3D 
                        printing, CNC milling, laser cutting...). <br><br>
                        - Cast and process every material. <br><br>
                        - Create the circuit of the device. <br><br>
                        - Develop the Arduino code of the program. <br><br>
                        - Work on the interface in P5.js. <br><br>
                    </div>

                    I won't elaborate on the fabrication because everything is well explained on the repo and there were 
                    lots of different procedures but here are some pictures of it: <br><br><br>

                    The thing we struggled with the most was the electronics part. None of our group is an expert in 
                    electronics or in coding so we had to get a lot of help from the FabLab team, which worked with us 
                    to get all the sensors running and get the data we wanted, and also send the inputs to P5. <br><br>

                    At the end of the week, we managed to have everything ready to work but still, we had to solve some 
                    troubleshooting with the Bluetooth connection of the ESP32 and we couldn't work on the interface as 
                    much as we wanted. However, we are happy with how this first iteration came out and we'll keep 
                    working on it the next week. The upcoming tasks will be: <br><br>                    

                    <div class="diagram">
                        - Get the electronics running with the battery connected. <br><br>
                        - Make sure Bluetooth connection is working properly. <br><br>
                        - Work on the P5 interface. <br><br>
                        - Design and mill a shield to connect all the sensors to the controller without the need for a 
                        breadboard. <br><br>
                        - Adapt the internal structure of the ball to the electronic components. <br><br>
                        - Create another version of the ball using other colours and materials. <br><br>
