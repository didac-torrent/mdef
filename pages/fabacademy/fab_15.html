                <h2>/interface_programming</h2>

                <p><strong>(10_may_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    The topic of this week was Interface and Application Programming or, in other words, how to translate 
                    all the data collected from our controllers and create a visual or auditive representation of it or 
                    the other way around, how to send data to a controller from a visual user interface. <br><br>

                    I was really looking forward to knowing and learning about this topic since I was missing it so much 
                    in my projects and it definitely gives a plus to every kind of digital interaction with a controller, 
                    being an Arduino, an ESP or whatever. I wanted to know how to transform all the data I was getting 
                    from the sensors into something more accessible and tangible for everyone. In fact, Vikrant and I 
                    already did something with that when we created the bracelet that turned colours into sounds, but in 
                    that case, we didn't have a visual representation and that could have been great also. <br><br>

                    <img src="../../images/p5js1.jpg" width="700px"> <br><br><br>

                    During the session, we learnt about different ways of creating interfaces with App Inventor, ESP Web 
                    Server and the two most popular: Processing and P5.js. We made a basic program to visually show the 
                    data collected live from an LDR, going step by step, from the libraries that one needs to install to 
                    how to use p5.serialcontrol. <br><br>

                    Finally, Victor gave us a short tutorial on how to program from Blender and how to transform it also 
                    in a visual representation, either 3D or 3D. <br><br>

                    <h3><span>.designing_an_interface</span></h3><br><br>
                    This task consisted of coding an interface using application programming with either P5.js, Processing 
                    or other to communicate with some input or output and then creating a Graphic User Interface to 
                    control the program. <br><br>

                    During the session, I followed the example Josep explained about showing the amount of light an LDR 
                    is getting and then displaying it in a graphical way. However, I wanted to show what we developed 
                    for the challenge (<a id="hype" href="https://github.com/aparna2806/fab-challenge-3/blob/main/README.md" 
                    target="_blank">OVERLOAD</a>). We created an interface that allowed us to communicate with Arduino IDE 
                    in a graphical way. We wanted to activate an air pump by tapping on our phone screens, which became 
                    a bit complex since sending information through Serial is more complex than getting it. <br><br><br>

                    <div class="img4">
                        <img src="../../images/gui1.gif" width="900px">
                    </div>

                    By using p5.serialcontrol and analysing the format of the information sent, we managed to make it 
                    work. However, I still wonder if there's a more optimal way to develop an interface like this that 
                    would also allow sending more information instead of just a HIGH or LOW. <br><br>
