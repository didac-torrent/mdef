                <p><strong>(10_may_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    The topic of this week was Interface and Application Programming or, in other words, how to translate 
                    all the data collected from our controllers and create a visual or auditive representation of it or 
                    the other way around, how to send data to a controller from a visual user interface. <br><br>

                    I was really looking forward to knowing and learning about this topic since I was missing it so much 
                    in my projects and it definitely gives a plus to every kind of digital interaction with a controller, 
                    being an Arduino, an ESP or whatever. I wanted to know how to transform all the data I was getting 
                    from the sensors into something more accessible and tangible for everyone. In fact, Vikrant and I 
                    already did something with that when we created the bracelet that turned colours into sounds, but in 
                    that case, we didn't have a visual representation and that could have been great also. <br><br>

                    During the session, we learnt about different ways of creating interfaces with App Inventor, ESP Web 
                    Server and the two most popular: Processing and P5.js. We made a basic program to visually show the 
                    data collected live from an LDR, going step by step, from the libraries that one needs to install to 
                    how to use p5.serialcontrol. <br><br>

                    Finally, Victor gave us a short tutorial on how to program from Blender and how to transform it also 
                    in a visual representation, either 3D or 3D. <br><br>
