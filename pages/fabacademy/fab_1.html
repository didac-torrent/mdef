                <h2>/project_management</h2>
                <p> <strong>(01_february_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    This first week of FabAcademy has put the spotlight on the Project Management topic, and more 
                    specifically on the creation of websites through different methods. Since we already did this 
                    step at the beginning of the masters, this sessions have been a way of discovering new alternatives 
                    and options to the apps and websites we are currently using, while at the same time consolidate all 
                    the information we knew from before. <br><br>

                    In my case, I created my website using Visual Studio Code and coding from scratch with HTML and 
                    CSS. I have been adding all the documentation in different pages and trying to experiment with 
                    diverse compositions and styles. I try to keep it minimal, without baroque elements that might 
                    distract from the important elements. I used Github as a hosting of my website.<br><br>
                    
                    I used the time given this week to update my website with the FabAcademy section and also to 
                    redistribute some other pages and elements from Design Studio and others. This is how my website
                    looks from inside (left) and from outside (right). <br><br>

                <h3><span>.documentation_from_other_students</span></h3>
                <p>
                    After doing some research on some of last year students' websites, I think I like the way of 
                    documenting from <a id="hype" href="https://roger_guilemany.gitlab.io/mdef-website/fabacademy.html" target="_blank">Roger</a>, 
                    <a id="hype" href="https://jana_tothillcalvo.gitlab.io/website/fabacademy.html" target="_blank">Jana</a> and 
                    <a id="hype" href="https://clement_rames.gitlab.io/mdef-website/fabacademy.html" target="_blank">Clément</a>. 
                    As I've said before, I'm an enthusiast of minimalism 
                    and I like to keep things simple. I believe Roger and Clément are also this kind of people since 
                    they don't add many decorations or else, just the important information to keep and the task. 
                    However, as far as I'm concerned, I would subdivide the different weeks and topics to make it easier 
                    to access and find instead of having the whole FabAcademy on a single page. <br><br>

                    On the other hand, I really admire Jana's website since I think she is a really creative person 
                    and her website itself is an artwork. What I really like about her way of documenting is that 
                    everything makes sense and every little thing is coherent with each other. Also, she doesn't add 
                    many images or else, just the reflection. Sometimes, adding lots of images doesn't really help. <br><br>

                    Finally, I'd like to comment on some of my classmates' websites like 
                    <a id="hype" href="https://gecrgehanna.github.io/mdefprocess/" target="_blank">George</a>'s that it's astonishing 
                    and the most artistic from the class or 
                    <a id="hype" href="https://chris-ernst.github.io/dozen-things-digital/" target="_blank">Chris</a>'s and his way 
                    of structuring and organising every element.
