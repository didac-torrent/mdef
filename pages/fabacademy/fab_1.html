                    This first week of FabAcademy has put the spotlight on the Project Management topic, and more 
                    specifically on the creation of websites through different methods. Since we already did this 
                    step at the beginning of the masters, this sessions have been a way of discovering new alternatives 
                    and options to the apps and websites we are currently using, while at the same time consolidate all 
                    the information we knew from before. <br><br>

                    In my case, I created my website using Visual Studio Code and coding from scratch with HTML and 
                    CSS. I have been adding all the documentation in different pages and trying to experiment with 
                    diverse compositions and styles. I try to keep it minimal, without baroque elements that might 
                    distract from the important elements. I used Github as a hosting of my website.<br><br>
                    
                    I used the time given this week to update my website with the FabAcademy section and also to 
                    redistribute some other pages and elements from Design Studio and others. This is how my website
                    looks from inside (left) and from outside (right). <br><br>
