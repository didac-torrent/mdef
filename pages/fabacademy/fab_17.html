                <p><strong>(24_may_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    This session of FabAcademy developed the topic of applications and implications. During the 
                    FabAcademy we've been developing mini projects and independent tasks in order to practice and 
                    learn about digital fabrication and prototyping technologies. However, we haven't talked that 
                    much about the applications of these technologies in real problems or situations. <br><br>

                    Through this session, we could see some real projects developed during FabAcademy in other places 
                    and years, such as the FabLab House made by some FabLab alumni. <br><br>

                    <h3><span>.reflecting_on_applications</span></h3><br><br>
                    To begin with, I wanted to comment that the project I'm developing is not a single machine or 
                    product, a thing that makes it a bit difficult to answer some of the questions proposed for this 
                    task. My project, SYNE, gathers different devices related to environmental sensing and 
                    experimentation with senses. The aim is to collect tools to democratise sensing, empathising with 
                    other realities and perceiving more from what is around us. <br><br>

                    Some projects have been developed around this topic, but it is hard to find one that gathers devices 
                    like the ones we created, that don't have a specific user but can be used by anyone in almost any 
                    context, always having the experimentation with senses as the connection point. <br><br>

                    All the tools created until now can be replicated and fabricated by anyone who has a 3D printer or 
                    a FabLab that has it close to them. They also require some controller such as an ESP32, ESP8266 or 
                    Arduino with a Bluetooth module and the sensors for each device. <br><br><br>

                    The cost of it would be different for each tool, and it would also 
                    depend on the price of the materials at each moment. For instance, microcontrollers now are more 
                    expensive than before because there's a lack of components. At the same time, 3D printing 
                    technologies and materials are everytime cheaper and more accessible to everyone. <br><br>

                    Since this is more of an experimental project, it doesn't need to answer a specific question. It's 
                    more about playing, feeling and empathising using our senses. Some of the applications for tools would be: <br><br>

                        - Schools: using the tools to make kids empathise with other realities or to practice their capabilities
                        of sensing. <br><br>

                        - Workshops: use the devices as a method to run other activites. <br><br>

                        - Art exhibitions: some tools can be used to perform exhibitions and to add value to it. They can add sound
                        and visuals.
