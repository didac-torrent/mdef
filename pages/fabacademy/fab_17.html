                <p><strong>(24_may_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    This session of FabAcademy developed the topic of applications and implications. During the 
                    FabAcademy we've been developing mini projects and independent tasks in order to practice and 
                    learn about digital fabrication and prototyping technologies. However, we haven't talked that 
                    much about the applications of these technologies in real problems or situations. <br><br>

                    Through this session, we could see some real projects developed during FabAcademy in other places 
                    and years, such as the FabLab House made by some FabLab alumni. <br><br>

                    <em> _What will it do?</em><br>
                    SYNE is a project that focuses on the perception of the environment and the use of our senses. The artefacts 
                    developed allow people to play, experiment, learn and empathise with their senses and explore reality and get to 
                    know it in a different way. Contrary to new technologies that isolate from the real world, SYNE aims at connecting 
                    people with their surroundings through different devices designed to interact either with the external world or with 
                    other subjects. <br><br>

                    <em> _Who’s done what beforehand?</em><br>
                    Some projects have been developed around this topic but not specifically with the same intention than mine.
                    On Instructables there are many projects focused on environmental sensing and wearables. There are some about creating
                    musical gloves that don't require a keyboard, sensing bracelets, tools to get weather information, etc.
                    Another environmental sensing project is SmartCitizen by FabLab Barcelona, where a small devices is 
                    used to collect data from the city and then process it. However, almost every project I have found around
                    the topic are quite experimental, and this is why it's a bit hard to find them. <br><br>

                    <em> _What will you design?</em><br>
                    For this project, I will design different tools focused on the use of senses and that can allow
                    the user to perceive the environment in an other way. 

                    <em> _What materials and components will be used?</em><br>
                    The materials used for the tools are basically materials that are 3D printable in a normal FDM printer,
                    that means PLA, PETG and TPU. These three materials will form the main structure of the devices since they
                    are easy to find, quite cheap and the most important, one can use them to fabricate with any 3D printer.
                    On the other hand, every tool requires electronics such as ESP32 controllers and sensors (touch sensor, 
                    sound sensors, accelerometer, colour sensor, etc.). <br><br>

                    <em> _Where will it come from? </em><br>
                    Every device can be replicated in a FabLab or in a place that has a 3D printer. The electronics
                    don't require other tools since they can be mounted on a breadboard. <br><br>

                    <em> _How much will they cost? </em><br>
                    The cost of it would be different for each tool, and it would also 
                    depend on the price of the materials at each moment. For instance, microcontrollers now are more 
                    expensive than before because there's a lack of components. At the same time, 3D printing 
                    technologies and materials are everytime cheaper and more accessible to everyone. <br><br>

                    <em> _What parts and systems will be made? </em><br>
                    In each tool there are generally three different systems: the external shape 3D printed, the electronics and 
                    the circuit, and finally the codes in Arduino and P5. Everything needs to work separately for the device
                    to work when assembled. <br><br>

                    <em> _What processes will be used?  </em><br>
                    There are many processes within this project. It's a combination between digital fabrication in relation to
                    design and prototyping technologies, electronics and coding to extract the data from the sensors and then 
                    process it, and finally art, specially for the arm wearable and the sensing ball when processing the data
                    in a less pragmatic way. <br><br>

                    <em> _What questions need to be answered?  </em><br>
                    What if we used tools like this in our daily lives?<br>
                    Would we feel different?<br>
                    Would our perception of reality change?<br>
                    Would these tools make us be more connected to the environment?<br>
                    Would we be more aware of our senses and their roles?<br>
                    Can this project help some collective?<br>
                    Which are the uses we can give to the tools created?<br><br>

                    <em> _How will it be evaluated? </em><br>
                    By analysing if the tools are useful, if they can help someone or make someone feel different while
                    using them. I need to get feedback from the users, see if they feel confident when using the tools
                    and try to find out in which other situations these tools could be used, either for art or for a 
                    functional use. <br><br><br>
