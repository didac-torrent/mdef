                <h2>/CNC_machining</h2>

                <p><strong>(15_march_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    During this week of FabAcademy, we explored all around CNC milling. This was one of the topics I was 
                    most interested in of the whole FacAcademy since I hadn't worked with it before, and I was looking 
                    forward to doing it. I was really curious to see how the huge CNC machine at FabLab works and also 
                    wanted to be able to cut a design of mine. <br><br>

                    During the session, we had a long explanation of how to use this big tool: the different kinds of 
                    CNC machines, the main parts they have, the process of creating a GCODE for each machine, the things 
                    one needs to take into account when designing, chip load calculation, materials and more. <br><br>

                    It was truly interesting to see different applications of CNC milling taking into consideration 
                    that there is an infinity of things one can do with it. Personally, I enjoy seeing objects created 
                    from stacked slices of wood on a big scale and structures created out of modules that have been 
                    CNC cut. <br><br>

                    One of the things I would also like to do is to build something in 2.5D using the CNC from FabLab, 
                    exploring the depth and organic shapes. I'm also interested in learning more deeply about CAM 
                    software. <br><br>

                    <h3><span>.milling_a_work_table</span></h3><br><br>
                    The task of this week consisted of designing and milling something for the big CNC machine. Each 
                    of us had half of a full board of wood (1200x1200mm) to cut whatever we had designed, preferably 
                    without screws or glue. <br><br>

                    Of course, having this chance of using a CNC to cut something that big is not a thing that happens 
                    every day, so I wanted to design and mill a thing that could be useful and meaningful at the same 
                    time.  <br><br>

                    Since my project doesn't really fit with CNC big scale cutting, I decided to create something for 
                    my nephew, that we could use for a long time. I am an enthusiast of crafting and hardworking so I 
                    decided I could do a small work table for him to start doing things with his own hands (just to put 
                    it in context, he is less than two years old). <br><br>

                    /IMAGE SKETCHES <br><br>

                    I made some research and then started sketching until I got to this design that looks a bit 
                    different from what one can find in the market, but at the same time has all the functionalities 
                    the other work tables offer. I was also all the time checking if the parts would fit into the half 
                    board, and had to split some of the legs in order to optimise the space. <br><br>

                    /IMAGE 3D <br><br>
                    /IMAGE 2D <br><br>

                    I modelled it on Fusion 360 to make sure everything would fit together and then exported the 2D 
                    files. The last step was to create the GCODE, in this case using Easel. For that, I created two 
                    processes: one for the attachment holes and another one for the actual milling of the object. This 
                    is how it looked: <br><br>

                    /IMAGE EASEL <br><br>

                    Finally, I cleaned each of the parts and assembled the whole body of the work table. This was a bit 
                    laborious since after cutting, the borders are not soft enough to directly assemble, so I had to 
                    sand each one of them. Then, they all fit together. This is how the work table looked after all this 
                    process: <br><br>

                    /IMAGE CUT <br><br>
                    /IMAGE ASSEMBLY <br><br>

                    However, this is still a work in progress and I will add more things to this work table. I want to 
                    3D print some parts and laser cut some others to complement the CNC cut. Hopefully, I'll have the 
                    final design ready someday... <br><br>
