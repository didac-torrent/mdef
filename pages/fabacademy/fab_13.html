                <h2>/INPUT_devices</h2>

                <p><strong>(26_april_2022)</strong><br><br>
                    The FabAcademy class after the holidays focused on the topic of Input Devices. Three weeks ago 
                    we talked about outputs (speakers, motors, lights, etc.) and this week was the turn of inputs or 
                    explained in another way, the information our circuit receives from the external agents. <br><br>

                    When we talk about inputs, we can summarize them in just one word: sensors. A sensor can be a 
                    button, a resistor, a microphone, or many other things. What makes it an input device is that 
                    it gets information from the exterior and transforms it into a numeric value (generally). 
                    Digital sensors, for example, get information that translates into 1 or 0, YES or NO, True or 
                    False. On the other hand, analog sensors can read more values and translate them from voltage to 
                    another scale. There are many protocols to transform the input we get from the sensors into 
                    information readable by our programs, they are called digital communication protocols.  <br><br>

                    The most important part of inputs, however, is the way we process the information we are getting. 
                    Each sensor has its properties and settings based on libraries and the way they are built. We need 
                    to know in which way we are receiving the data in order to process it meaningfully. It's not 
                    the same to process a sound input or image one. The way we display or use the information is 
                    what gives value to the sensors themselves.  <br><br>

                    During the second part of the session, we took a look to how to fabricate our own sensors in a 
                    DIY way. We saw some examples of fabricating a force sensitive resistor, a shock sensor, a plant 
                    moisture sensor and some others. <br><br>
